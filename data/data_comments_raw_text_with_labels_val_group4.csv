It is literally the very definition of being fascist when you threaten people that protest with taking children, freezing bank accounts, and forcing people to inject something into their bodies that they are not comfortable with.  

Control, oppression, tyranny.  Fascism.

It is not *at all* something that solely belongs to the far right, politically speaking."

Beloved host and advocate for blue-collar workers Mike Rowe explained in December the real meaning behind the highly-popularized, ‚Äúclever,‚Äù and ‚Äúhysterical‚Äù chant.

‚ÄúThe times that we‚Äôre living in right now are forcing lots of people on both sides of the aisle to look at a thing, or hear a thing, and be told that what they‚Äôre seeing and what they‚Äôre hearing is not real,‚Äù Rowe said. ‚ÄúAnd you can‚Äôt do that to people indefinitely and expect them not to push back somehow. You can‚Äôt tell people that the border is secure and then show them images of tens of thousands of people flooding over it. You can‚Äôt tell people that the evacuation of Afghanistan was a success and then show them people falling off of a plane. ‚Ä¶ And you can‚Äôt ask people who are watching a NASCAR race at home, who clearly hear the crowd yelling ‚ÄòF*** Joe Biden‚Äô to pretend that what they‚Äôre really hearing is ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs Go Brandon.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúI think what‚Äôs happened is people have just become sick and tired of being told that what they‚Äôre seeing and what they‚Äôre hearing is not what they‚Äôre seeing and hearing,‚Äù Rowe emphasized.

‚ÄúAnd this is the perfect trope,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think people who"

Queen Elizabeth is their sovereign.  He's going Medieval on the truckers to appease champagne socialists, elitist globalists.

Both of those were disasters, but anyway people don't seem to be treating this like another Vietnam or Afghanistan, everyone seems to be talking about WWIII. Maybe they're just being hyperbolic, but I'd assume a draft isn't totally off the table if it gets that bad (while not getting bad enough for nukes). And if it is off the table, then we should just get rid of it.

106,"hy2dw73",4,1,"/r/Conservative","Yeah, so tough that we are in this situation now, even though the issue had been around throughout Trumps entire administration. Yet Putin made no move. Why now?

However, during that period, there was still a massive increase in the debt, a steady increase in the deficit, and continued money printing from the Federal Reserve. So long as those trends continue, everything is just bubble and busts, with some good growth on the side that will be wiped out in the next bust for everyone but the corporate and political elites.

So at this point, the protestors have two choices: Submit and face the judgement of the government, or get violent.

This really is January 6th over again, but not how they say it is. It's proof positive that they're absolutely fine with protests, even riots, until it targets *them*. Then you have to be made an example of. So that no one dares question almighty government."

That is and should be the difference as we are the ""United"" States...not the we need to wait around states.

The banks most definitely did not pay their fair share let alone the lions share and considering just how much they get on bailouts for probably that they cause its embarrassing that you would even attempt to defend them.

A good example is when Biden told Ukraine he was leaving in 6 hours with the billion dollars in guaranteed aid money if they didn't fire the prosecutor investigating Burisma. The Burisma investigation was actually opened up by the Latvian government and covered a large racket of money laundering.

Your system won't work if substantial portion of the population isnt working and paying into it.

Also nato members have enriched Russia by buying their oil and gas and have not met the 2% of GDP required to be spent on their own defense as nato members practically ever so of course we would end up funding the war.

I imagine other conservatives feel similarly. Also, the left's environmental policies actively punish the poor, whom the left claim to be champions of.

We will continue to see people move to the states that align more with their political leanings. As a result, the red states and blue states will become more and red and blue, respectively. If things continue to the trend this way rhetorically, we will see a national divorce that will be mutual. However, the blue states will align themselves more with the likes of Canada, Western Europe and China.

The separated red states will be demonized on a global level. And once they have the backing they need from other global powers, the blue states will sanction the newly divorced red states and attempt to suffocate them into submission through resource restriction, etc. The red states will retaliate violently, and a war will breakout. Tens of millions of people will die. America will be destroyed, and China will swoop in and establish their governing system. Trans people, openly gay public figures who promulgated fringe ideals, and far leftists who called themselves Antifa or Antifa apologists, basically all who complained about the petty inconveniences and oppression under our current system, will be identified and sent to re-education camps or executed. Some portions of red states will be able to stave off China's initial aggression, but they will never be able to reorganize. China will repeatedly use experimental weaponry in those portions of the country: nanotechnology, bioweapons, smart bombs, etc.

My prediction goes off the rails at this point.

Over time, perhaps in a 100 years or so, some of the heirs of the dipshits that thought they were on the right side of history will decide that being plugged into an alternate reality for their entire lives isn't want they want. They will attempt to rise up and overthrow whatever regime that holds power, but I'm sure at that point the mind control devices and weaponry will be nearly insurmountable, so they will fail.

At some point, the Chino-American government will carve out funding for a scientist named Anthony Fauci VI who specializes in black hole research. Despite warnings from other scientists about the dangers of black hole simulation, Anthony Fauci VI will continue his experimentation and accidentally create a black hole in a lab in Roseburg, Oregon. It will expand extremely slowly, yet it will consume everything in its path.

Anthony Fauci VI will be brought before a special tribunal where Chino-american politicians will interrogate him; however, being an expert liar, he will evade imprisonment and half the country will call him a hero. Other scientists, who have ties to Anthony Fauci VI, will receive a massive subsidy and invent a device that will be able to create a gravitational constant equal to that of that the black hole, effectively putting an end to its expansion. Unfortunately, an unforeseen circumstance will arise when it's discovered that the device emits an enormous amount of radiation that is highly transferrable from one human to another. In an effort to counteract the effects of the radiation, they will create an injectable substance containing nanoparticles that will absorb the radiation. They will doctor the trial results and ignore any long-term risk of the injection and it will prematurely be declared a scientific triumph. All of this will occur during the same time that Chino-European scientists invent their own gravitational device, but one that doesn't emit radiation. They will try to bring attention to it, but the Chino-Americans, not wanting to shed light on the failings of their own subsidized experiment, will arrest the Chino-European scientists, confiscate their research and execute them by throwing them into the black hole."

The US Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, DC, affirmed the lower court's ruling in a blistering 68-page opinion written by Judge Patricia Millett.
  

  
""Benjamin Franklin said, at the founding, that we have '\[a\] Republic'‚Äî'if \[we\] can keep it.' The events of January 6th exposed the fragility of those democratic institutions and traditions that we had perhaps come to take for granted,"" Millett wrote.
  

  
Both the incumbent president and Congress determined that ""access to this subset of presidential communication records is necessary to address a matter of great constitutional moment for the Republic,"" she added.
  

  
""Former President Trump has given this court no legal reason to cast aside President Biden's assessment of the Executive Branch interests at stake, or to create a separation of powers conflict that the Political Branches have avoided,"" the ruling said.


  

  
The Supreme Court's January order specifically left unaddressed some key questions, including to what extent a former president can shield their documents from public release. The court wrote that these topics were ""unprecedented"" and ""raise serious and substantial concerns.""  
In the weeks since the Supreme Court declined to block the archives from turning over documents to the January 6 select committee, it surfaced that Trump took around 15 boxes of White House documents to his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida.  
NARA said in a letter to lawmakers on Friday that it communicated with Trump advisors about the materials last year, received the 15 boxes last month, and is still in the process of inventorying its contents. The records that Trump belatedly turned over reportedly include documents related to some of his most infamous moments like ""Sharpiegate,"" the doctored map of Hurricane Dorian's path.  
The agency said that among other things, it recently learned that some of the boxes Trump took with him contained classified national security information.

  
NARA recently asked the Justice Department to investigate whether Trump violated federal law by taking documents with him to Mar-a-Lago that should have been turned over to the archives at the end of his presidency.  
Legal experts have said that Trump's actions may have violated the Presidential Records Act, which requires presidents and White House staff to preserve official documents and communications, and turn those items over to the Archives at the end of a president's term.  
The January 6 Committee request for Trump's records comes as lawmakers try to piece together Trump's movements and actions on the day of the Capitol riot. Rep. Liz Cheney, the top Republican on the panel, has suggested that Trump's failure to immediately condemn rioters amounts to a dereliction of duty."""

""Last night, Putin recognised the independence of the two regions.

Today he exerted that these regions extend deeper than the ones he's currently recognised as independent.

If you listen up to his speech last night, he's setting up to go much further than these territories.

Who in God's name does Putin think that he has the right to declare countries. This warrants a firm response from the other countries.

I told Putin a month ago, that we would act.

Today, I'm announcing the first tranche of action, closely coordinated with our allies and partner. The sanctions will target FIB and their military bank. We will cut off Russian Government from Western finances, so that they cannot trade its debt at Western market. We will also impose sanctions on the oligarchs profiting from this corrupt system

We worked with Germany to ensure that Nordstream II will not move forward.

**If Russia continues, our sanctions will increase. USA will provide additional equipment to Ukraine, and to strengthen our Baltic allies. This is a defensive motive - we will defend every inch of NATO territory.**

I hope I'm wrong that Russia will invade Ukraine, including Kyiv. Russia has Ukraine surrounded, form the North to Kyiv. Russia has amphibious ships in the Black sea and blood banks at the borders.

**You don't need blood unless you're planning a war.**

Last week, you have seen the Russian playbook Blinken laid out played out - you've seen the Russian Security Council meeting, and the recognition of the Independence. And now Russian ? has voted to send Russian military to Ukraine. This sets the stage for further pretext.

None of us should be fooled. If Russia proceed, it's Russia and Russia alone that bears responsibility.

We stand ready to protect American businesses and consumers. We are making sure that the price of our sanctions is paid by Russian economy, not ours. I wanna limit the pain of the American people at the gas pump - that's important to me.

I met with the German chancellor, Harris met with Zelensky last week. We stand united with our allies against the Russian threat that Russia is making

La**st night, the entire world heard clearly Putin's vision - nothing in his remarks indicates that he's willing to negotiate. He threatened countries that are now thriving democracies and NATO members.**

**The US and its allies remain open to diplomacy if it's made as an honest effort.**"

Growing up, Marriage was seen as almost entirely religious in nature.  You went and got married by a priest.  It was frowned on to get married by a justice of the peace, or pretty much anywhere but a church.

The word, Marriage, triggers those religious connotations and a kneejerk response of HOLUP!!!

However, we've also tied a lot of NON religious things to marriage.  Seeing someone in a hospital, health insurance, prison visits, taxes, etc.

Your middle class aunt is kneejerking to the religious aspect.  the 'Sanctity' of marriage.  

You might point out that no, Gay people aren't going to take over her super conservative idiot church.  Gay people are just people and deserve the same CIVIL rights (taxes, hospital visits, etc) as anyone else.  CHURCH rights are between them and the church.  And there are plenty of Churches that are just fine with Gay Marriage.

Hence he didn't vote to convict Trump in the 2nd Impeachment but said that he knew he was responsible for it all and that justice would catch up to him.

7914,"hy2n5w7",4,0,"/r/politics","So, I'm on the other side. I generally believe in the right to self defense, however, I do believe that there is a duty to attempt to retreat except where castle doctrine is in play. There are situations where it is reasonable to believe that an invasion of one's place of residence or retreat is a threat to body and life. I am against public stand your ground laws on the grounds that upon entering the agora, your right to defend yourself is necessarily impinged upon by the rights of the collective to a space free of violence except where that peace has already been demonstrably and without a doubt terminated.

Unfortunately, and here's the problem:

Even if the data proved beyond a reasonable doubt a causation, the American South (my home) has a dire problem of malice, misanthropy, and mistrust.  There are a wide audience of people like me, who believe in the right to self defense who unlike me, argue that this means that there are homicides that are not only not criminal, but that they are right.

To put it another way: To many supporters of stand your ground laws, the additional homicides, if undeniably proven to be caused by the implementation of stand your ground laws, are not just acceptable, they are desired, as the American South has become so misanthropic that it believes that those who will die due to this largely deserve death. The widespread availability of firearms in the US puts us in a unique position as a nation where we tacitly accept homicide as a necessary consequence of the right to individual bodily autonomy... And that's a big social problem.

I don't believe that these numbers demonstrate adequately that stand your ground laws increase homicide rates upon implementation, but I do believe that they do demonstrate that they do not decrease homicides upon implementation: The justification that they make people safer in their person or their homes cannot be rationally supported.

The question you have to ask yourself ultimately, is who you are arguing deserves to live, and who deserves to die, and whether stand your ground laws are effective at sorting those parties out. --For a multitude of reasons, I do not believe that this is the case. It merely aids in ensuring that a homicide is less likely to be seen as a crime, which in some cases might be justice, and in others, may not be."

We failed on covid for a lot of reasons that have nothing to do with wealth. 

We had a terrible president who undermined the public response at every opportunity and basically instructed his core supporters (about 40% of the population) to ignore restrictions and spread the virus freely. 

Our healthcare system is underfunded (by choice, we have the money but choose not to spend it).

Our government is very decentralized institutionally prevented from acting decisively throughout the country. Where other countries could simply say, ""next Monday, every school in the country is closed"" - the United States had 50 governors fighting their own legislatures, who in turn were fighting city governments and even local school district administrators. 

Meanwhile - outside of our horrible covid response, America is a very rich country. If California, just one of our 50 states, were a country, it would be a larger economy, on its own, than the entire United Kingdom. And that only represents 12 percent of the USA's population.

The US has a MASSIVE gap between the rich and the poor, and that makes us an outlier in both positive and negative ways.

We have the best Universities in the world and routinely out-produce the world in Nobel winners. We have an economy that is very dynamic and routinely births $1 billion global companies seemingly out of thin air.

We also have tremendous poverty and hunger, including among children, ridiculously disparate healthcare and education outcomes by race, and a gun violence problem that nobody else in the so-called ""developed world"" can understand."

I almost find this hard to believe, only because I've literally never met anyone who isnt white who is naive enough to actually believe white Americans are at the bottom of the govt subsidy totem pole. Literally every race neutral govt program is de facto for whites, because whites own the majority of farmland, stocks, businesses and wealth in general. The poorest whites benefit as much as or more than blacks from welfare. And even in explicitly race based policies such as affirmative action, it is often not whites who are disproportionately underserved. When the UC system blinded its applicants in terms of race, the proportion of white students at its flagship schools did not go up, but Asians. In other words, AA is a program designed to give spots from Asian Americans to under represented minorities. I'm not here to debate whether or not the program is meritorious, but the fact remains that whites are absolutely never on the bottom of the totem pole for anything. 

With respect to my personal biases, I would not replace whites with blacks in my statement because I do not feel that way about blacks. Furthermore, I feel that I am able to separate what I think about a group from how I interact with individuals. Frankly I have no choice because white Americans are the large majority of people I interact with daily anyway. So just because I think Americans happen to be conceited, whiny, lazy hypocrites and that American culture happens to be superficial, materialistic, boorish, and anti intellectual, does not mean that I cannot treat friends, colleagues, and patients with dignity and respect until they give me reason to do otherwise.

If posed that question they'd tell you that ""democracy"" *means* single party Christian rule, and give you some seriously looney explanation of how ""democracy"" was handed down by God to the founding fathers and that the Republican party is not only His chosen political organization in US politics but also, consequently, the true heirs to the founding fathers. Then they'd explain how ""true democracy"" thus, by definition, does not include non-Christians or non-Republicans.

*Then* they'd explain how post-modern, Jewish, Marxist academics have have used Hollywood and the liberal media to brainwash people like you into having your twisted, demonic view of ""democracy"" that includes things like religious tolerance, secularism, and plurality of ideas.

So, by destroying as it currently stands they are actually *saving* the US as it was ""supposed"" to be."

In fact, my opinion that colleges shouldn't be for profit is the main reason why I disagree with the entire substance of your original comment, which suggested that cutting things like Athletics to increase profits would mitigate the problem. Not only does that not make sense in the first place (because it might REDUCE profits, as I already explained)  increasing college's profits shouldn't be the point at all. The things that need the most money in education, like academic programs, research, and valuable student support services, are NOT profitable. Which is why the solution to the problem is along the lines of REMOVING profit incentives and fully funding those important functions irrespective of profit. The solution to the problem doesn't have anything to do with increasing profits, which is what you argued in your original comment."

1) I think it's a lot more nuanced and grey then what you've stated.

2) I think it's missing the bigger picture in favor of a couple of true-ish details. 


>The nuclear family concept is an artificial construct designed by an outdated system of puritanical morals.

What is an artificial construct? Picking a berry from a bush to eat may be as conceivably ""natural"" an act as one could imagine a human doing, but how about spearing a wild boar? We have the digestive system and dental structure to suggest and omnivorous diet, we have opposable thumbs and the dexterity to suggest we are natural tool-makers, is the spear an artificial construct?

Everything humans create, and all of the behaviors humans exhibit are products of our evolutionary programming. Some instinctual,  some learned post-birth, our vocal cords are the evolutionary result of the advantage being able to transfer this learned knowledge was.

The ""puritanical morals"" stem from our evolutionary roots as well. Humans didn't just randomly decide ""women should be virgins"", but it was a policy derived from men's aversion to investing resources in a mate that may not be bearing his child. It's not common throughout history that women specifically seek out virgin men, because they simply cannot physically bear another women's child. What is common is that men in positions of power attract the attention of women, because of the implication of safety and resources during a vulnerable pregnancy. Men that ""did not care"" about a woman's promiscuity were more likely to end up raising the offspring of another man and not passing on *his* genes, so you end up with a male population that tend to be sexually possessive and exhibit behaviors like mate guarding. 

>Going back before modern religion, we see tribes that lived as a communal entity to care for children, the old, and the infirm.

This is true! But nomadic tribes function differently than more modern societies. Our ""natural"" sexual tendencies can be inferred by our genitalia and level sexual dimorphism between sexes. When both sexes look roughly the same, that's an indicator that there isn't much competition and offspring are either raised as a community or left to fend for themselves. When there is a larger physical difference between males and females, that indicates males have to ""compete"" for females and tend to grow larger, stronger, develop large horns or impressive colorful feathers. Testical volume also determines the level of competition, and is indicative of a more ""poly"" society. Humans are ""naturally"" somewhere in the middle. We tend to gravitate towards short term monogamy with some extra partners when a good opportunity presents itself. This makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint, but I'm going to cut it here before I drone on too long.

>Polyandrous and polygynous societies were not uncommon, and there is some anthropological evidence that they were as strong as if not more so than the modern christian version of society.

As with everything when it comes to evolution, the most successful strategy dominates. Poly societies are not the dominate force today because they are not conducive to the continuation of large societies. There is nothing ""wrong"" with poly, they are just simply unsustainable. In monogamous societies, men have the motivation of a woman of their own and a family to provide for to drive productivity. In large scale poly societies, there are incredibly large numbers of men that do not get a partner and this becomes self destructive."

People being deregistered or changed to a different party affiliation as we‚Äôve seen in Fl.

Saying that voting worked, sort of, two years ago and that it should again after the Fascist party has, for two years, continued to rig the voting apparatus in their favor is naive at best.

We should absolutely vote and encourage others to vote but in the event these Fascists take what little is remaining of democracy from us - we need to figure out a way to organize quickly and plan how we proceed."

It should be pretty obvious that these two things can‚Äôt coexist simultaneously (at least without one of them just being a straight-up lie), so instead of trying to unite these factions they‚Äôve decided to play a different game and bank on voters following party lines like they always do.

not just lip service. actual laws spelling out protections. yea, you can march in pride parades, you can say ""trans rights"". you can put the trans pride flag in your office window or whatever

but unless you're voting for progressive candidates that actually have laws and ideas ready to protect us (yes i said us. i am transwoman living in Pennsylvania; Republicans terrify me here too) then it's all lip service.

So his idea is essentially to invade a portion of Mexico, declare it 'independent', and send in tanks. Which is effectively annexing a part of Mexico? So all the people who are in that portion of Mexico are then effectively in the USA?! So his plan to stop people illegally crossing the southern border to get into the USA is to move the border around them so they are already in the USA?!?

10878,"hy4699v",4,0,"/r/politics","Honestly, this line of thinking is so toxic and misinformed. Why are democrats not passing voting rights? Or accomplishing the other things they promised to do on the campaign trail? The answer is look at the senate. Democrats didn‚Äôt win by enough to be able to change things unilaterally. A 50-50 senate with Joe Manchin as the 50th vote means that we can only be as progressive as Joe Manchin wants us to be. 

If democrats had gotten more votes, had gotten just a few more senate seats, then you would see real talk about filibuster reform and then you could see big pieces of legislation moving to the presidents desk. Even in a 50-50 senate, they pushed for it hard. Tried to get Manchin there, and they are still pushing, but Biden isn‚Äôt a dictator and Senators get yo vote how they want, even if they caucus as a democrat.
