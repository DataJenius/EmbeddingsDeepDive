The willingness of Canadians to seemingly happily grant this sort of power to a central authority, for a non-emergency, is terrifying to those of us with an already low degree of trust in federal government in the US. It's too close to home not just in proximity, but in values.

Think about the fact that a group of peaceful protestors, exercising their right to protest (can argue about blocking roadways for sure), entirely peaceful, was demonized as some evil white supremecist, Nazi movement.  They were protesting government tyranny and then put down by some questionably exercised emergency powers (aka ramped up government tyranny).

It's literally an obstacle to left's designs for the future for minorities to achieve success and for there to be harmonious race relations. They don't actually want that. They need a constant underclass and a constant stream of class warfare to justify their positions. So they create the very problem that they offer the solutions to, and the solutions are always thinly-veiled authoritarian power grabs.

They always need a fake moral cause in order to validate their authoritarianism. It's always about increasing government power and stripping people of their rights. Authoritarianism is the actual goal of every single leftist talking point, about every single issue. Economics, health care, race relations, and environmental issues. People can note that every time the left has a plan to tackle a problem that is the flavor of the week, the plan basically amounts to stripping people of their rights, increasing government control, limiting national sovereignty, and achieving a laundry list from a globalists' most deranged imaginings. 

Back to race though, just about every lingering social problem that black people face specifically in the US is a result of decades of Democrat policies and left-wing ideology being spread in academia, in the media, and in pop culture. Any law, policy, or economic development that actually improves the condition of black people in the US long-term is vehemently opposed by Democrats. 

Before the pandemic, Trump's policies resulted in record low unemployment in every single racial group in the US, energy independence for the US, rabid wage growth, and a huge surge in entrepreneurial success in black communities. This was the result of tax cuts and loosening regulations. The entire opposition that Trump faced by Democrats revolves around their fear of the fact that his policies would give minorities in the US a taste of economic success that didn't depend on Democrat-implemented government handouts."

It's something that confuses the pro-abortion crowd because in their eyes it's hypocritical and in a way I find it hard to disagree unless we attach an asterisk that says life matters -if you're a US citizen.

Now I fully understand America can't fix the problems of every child on the planet and ""for the children!"" can be abused but as a society we fight harder for the rights of the unborn then we do for the quality of their lives once born.

What Democrats have learned is they can push their political wet dreams every time they get power and it makes little difference on the shift in power. 

Obama came into office with a super majority. Democrats pushed Financial reform for a problem they created that no one asked for. They pushed climate change which wasn't even a top 10 issue for Americans. And they pushed healthcare reform which wasn't even a top 20 issue for Americans.

All of them far left stances and not even a decade later they regained control of Congress and then the presidency. So called moderates just shifted left with them as it became the new ""normal"".

But to make your stance even worse. Even with a popular Reaganesque president, the Pendulum *still swings*. Reagan was hampered by having a fully Democrat House and Senate for 6 of his 8 years in office. Meaning that if Republicans wait to tackle the issue they will *never* tackle the issue.

This applies to conservative issues across the board, not just abortion. If Republicans are not willing to implement real and meaningful reforms while in power they have squandered their capacity to do so. It's less a conservative party (American sense of word, not European) and more a status quo Party. As in no one can ever expect Republicans to do anything."

The US already has a bunch of sanctions, that were put in under Obama. Their impact has been counterproductive. Russia is much less dependent on the west because of it, and worse, built closer links to China to withstand future sanctions. End result, China has also become stronger. More sanctions would have just pissed off more allies.

The same arguments against Nordstream 2 were used for Nordstream 1. They turned out to be BS. (Basically Russia used to supply gas to EU through Poland and Ukraine. Ukraine used to steal gas whenever it was having issues. After Nordstream 1 they could bypass Ukraine and Poland if they wanted. Sucks for Ukraine and Poland, but great for the rest of Europe. Nordstream 2 extends the pipleline.)

The bottom line is countries want to do business with Russia. They **want** cheap Russian gas.  If they wanted to reduce Russian gas consumption, they would have done so. They don't care about Ukraine. Germany may not certify Nordstream 2 now, but that's because the winter is nearly over, and they get gas in any case through Nordstream 1. If next winter is cold, they will quietly turn on Nordstream 2 as well.

---------------------------------------

US sanctions cause pain to other countries, because the US controls a lot of the financial systems (in particular SWIFT).

(for background https://fee.org/articles/swift-and-the-weaponization-of-the-us-dollar/ )


Countries do not like pain. They use systems that the US has control over because they are convenient. At some point they will switch over to systems that the US has no control over. They are already looking. This just increases the incentives to switch.

At the end of the day, a large part of US prosperity is because the rest of the world uses the dollar system to trade. If the rest of the world decides that it is no longer worth using US systems for trade, the US will suffer greatly."

For any folks who don't know, in Canada the reigning party can call elections at any time by claiming a vote to pass a bill is also a confidence vote in the government's leadership. If the government loses the confidence of the house, an election is called.

It's a sad example of how democracy is often wielded as a threat in Canada because the ruling party knows that voters don't like being forced to return to the polls more often than needed. Therefore this is basically a threat to the NDP who're too broke to afford an election (shocking I know, the Socialists are broke), telling them to stay in line *or else.*"

At any point, if a majority of MPs  feel they don't like how things are going in government, they can have a vote of no confidence.  Major pieces of legislature are often seen as confidence bills. Because if the ruling party can't pass important legislature, then why are they running things?  If the ruling party fails to win enough votes in a confidence vote then elections are triggered and hopefully the next group of MPs can get it sorted out. 

For context, they had an election last year.  Also elections are expensive so if your party is still in debt financing the last election, you might not want new elections.  Doubly so if you are a small minority party in alliance with the ruling party who doesn't have a majority in parliament."

Diplomacy and geopolitics is not exactly a game where everyone plays fair and is expected to get along. Everyone is out for their own interests as states and they will use whatever advantages they can to get ahead. It is very machiavellian, but it comes down to basic human nature. That is how diplomacy has always been conducted, the issue is when diplomacy fails and leads to war. 

If anything when everyone is out for themselves it makes diplomacy far easier because you can more reasonably expect what the person on the other side of the table wants and will do instead of like the EU where you might be talking to a German, but are dealing with some issue about Greece or just the collective overall.

Also so you are saying the two breakaway republics should have self determination, what about the rest of Ukraine who still consider those two areas integral parts of their nation? Do their opinions and understanding of their country not matter? Only those break away republics and Russia‚Äôs?

So, knowing the effective impact on the US, Trump took a hardline approach to China on protecting trade routes with freedom of navigation drills supporting their sovereignty (without fully recognizing it diplomatically and causing hard issues with China) and supplying their military.  Ukraine offers little value to the US in terms of export goods and the such, but are important in Europe‚Äôs geopolitics and securing the pipelines that extend through Ukraine.

Beloved host and advocate for blue-collar workers Mike Rowe explained in December the real meaning behind the highly-popularized, ‚Äúclever,‚Äù and ‚Äúhysterical‚Äù chant.

‚ÄúThe times that we‚Äôre living in right now are forcing lots of people on both sides of the aisle to look at a thing, or hear a thing, and be told that what they‚Äôre seeing and what they‚Äôre hearing is not real,‚Äù Rowe said. ‚ÄúAnd you can‚Äôt do that to people indefinitely and expect them not to push back somehow. You can‚Äôt tell people that the border is secure and then show them images of tens of thousands of people flooding over it. You can‚Äôt tell people that the evacuation of Afghanistan was a success and then show them people falling off of a plane. ‚Ä¶ And you can‚Äôt ask people who are watching a NASCAR race at home, who clearly hear the crowd yelling ‚ÄòF*** Joe Biden‚Äô to pretend that what they‚Äôre really hearing is ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs Go Brandon.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúI think what‚Äôs happened is people have just become sick and tired of being told that what they‚Äôre seeing and what they‚Äôre hearing is not what they‚Äôre seeing and hearing,‚Äù Rowe emphasized.

‚ÄúAnd this is the perfect trope,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think people who yell it are necessarily enemies of the president. I think they‚Äôre enemies of being told that what they‚Äôre seeing and what they‚Äôre hearing isn‚Äôt real, that it‚Äôs somehow a figment of their imagination. People are sick of that.‚Äù"

He has absolutely nothing left, he was defeated legislatively and economically, the only thing he has left is to wag to dog, the same thing that they were so afraid that Trump would do but never did.

>What similarities do you actually see?

One of the first things Hitler did was pass the [Reichstag Fire Decree](https://www.ushmm.org/learn/timeline-of-events/1933-1938/reichstag-fire-decree).
It was passed in response to an emergency declaration, the reichstag fire, and was justified by Hindenburg as ""for the Protection of People and the Reich.""  They used it to outlaw protests by their political opponents and even put them in the first camps.  

The COVID mandates and restrictions follow the same thought.  Punishing people for breaking restrictions meant to ""keep people and Canada safe"". Even putting some in prison.


Invoking the emergency powers act for the first time in history to put down a non-violent protest.  That allowed them to basically do what they wanted and resulted in the seizure of property, freezing of funds, and disregard for life when the RCMP trampled people with their horses.  A lot of them will probably spend time in jail simply for protesting their government.  They even threatened people who donated to the protest.

4219,"hy0fdgf",1,1,"/r/Conservative","Obviously, no two situations are 100% the same, but Hitler's claims to Sudetenland, Danzig, and Anschluss were actually far more reasonable than Putin threatening to invade the whole of Ukraine. The original sin that led to WWII was the oppressive, punitive Treaty of Versailles that directly led to the rise of Hitler through democratic means. Millions of Germans were left stranded in Sudetenland and Danzig and forced to live under foreign rules in the interwar period. The tragedy repeated itself post-WWII when as many as [2.5 million Germans died and 14.6 million were ethnically cleansed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_and_expulsion_of_Germans_(1944%E2%80%931950)). Even Anschluss made sense because Austria and Prussia (founder of German Empire aka Second Reich) were the leading states of the predominantly German-speaking Holy Roman Empire (aka First Reich). The forced abdications of both the Habsburgs and Hohenzollerns (Kaiser Wilhelm II) removed the 2 countries' royalists from the equation.

Putin's 2014 annexation of Crimea at least could be justified on ethnic ground and self-determination as Crimea had a Russian majority and voted to unite with Russia. Even Donetsk could be justified on similar grounds. But Ukrainians have never been Russians, so invading the entire Ukraine is blatant empire building. Just like Hitler lost his moral high ground when he invaded the entire Czechoslovakia. There was a reason the USSR downplayed race, but rather strictly focused on the communist ideology. They knew pushing a Russian chauvinist narrative would immediately lead to ethnic tensions and never-ending civil wars, just like Yugoslavia immediately collapsed when they replaced communism with Serbian chauvinism post-Cold War. Heck, many of the most prominent Soviet Union leaders were not even Russians. Stalin was Georgian. Khruschev was Ukrainian. Trotsky was Jewish (Tito was not a Serb either. He was born to a Croat father and Slovene mother). Having ethnic minority as leaders reinforced the idea that these communist states were ""color-blind,"" which was what held them together."

Poland and the Baltic countries have been the only European countries to sound the alarm and make plans to counter a resurgent Russia. 

2. By allowing Nord Stream 1 and 2 it puts Europe‚Äôs largest economy at the mercy of what could possibly be a near term enemy in Russia. Russia could use those pipelines to blackmail and or strangle Germany‚Äôs economy which in turn strangles Germany‚Äôs military. 

3. Russia has refused to join the ‚ÄúWestern‚Äù world in economic and military pacts despite joint military exercises, diplomatic and economic exchanges. They always site and have used the excuse of a ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù threat along their western borders to attempt to reestablish the old Soviet buffer.  

4. The U.S. under Trump wanted to untangle itself from foreign wars. He saw the long term plan of Russia. Russia by allying itself with China and refusing to join Western Europe, showed that Putin has no interest in security but only reestablishing or attempting to reestablish the Soviet Union. By Germany allowing the Nord Stream Pipelines, it meant Germany would be at the mercy of an aggressive Russia which means the U.S. would have to stay in Europe to protect the weak Europeans.

It is concerning but we need to avoid going to war over this. Focus on developing and strengthening our own military. Contribute with installations of anti missile systems in Europe. Force Europe to pick up it's fair share of defense by making it clear the us will not serve as their police, etc.

If there were any statement, I would make it on the importance of sovereign states controlling their borders  I am not even sure a rebuke a this point is worth it. Self determination is a fundamental human right. There is no 'right' for the nation of Ukraine to control those territories. Governments only have sovereignty over a territory insofar as the *actual* people in that territory support that government. That is a fundamental stance undertaken by our very foundational documents... The British loyalists argued that Britain has control over the colonies by law and that this legitimated their continued presence in modern day america.

Daniel Miessler describes Rubin as ""behaving exactly like a liberal with a severe case of PTSD,"" and there is a lot of truth to that. (It also describes people like Joe Rogan, a classical liberal whom the left is leaving far behind as they push and shove to a progressive extreme.)

**Classical liberals** were committed to stripping the church and state of their centralized authoritarian power and dispersing it into the hands of a free people, arguing for individual secular freedom instead of centralized authority like unelected monarchs. Out of this root grew branches that would lead to **progressives** on the one hand and **conservatives** on the other, two branches sharing the same trunk in common.

In other words, someone identifying as a ""liberal"" doesn't necessarily indicate whether they are progressive or conservative; they could be either one. A *progressive* liberal believes in using a democratically elected government to facilitate or force progress, whereas a *conservative* liberal believes that government should conserve the social and economic integrity and norms of a free society that is left alone as much as possible.

Just for the sake of interest, Miessler does [a nice breakdown of the classical liberals](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/a-visual-breakdown-of-intellectual-dark-web-idw-political-positions/) in the intellectual dark web (such as Rubin, Same Harris, Rogan, etc.) and where they sit on the progressive to conservative scale.

5823,"hy2qjn9",1,0,"/r/politics","With your first point; there's tons of factors that make your comparison pretty bad... Like the 2008 recession; I'm pretty sure we can all say BANKERS of all people should be good at estimating their risk when they loan money... and they still took those risks... 

Meanwhile many people getting student loans are ages 17-19... 17 isn't even adulthood in most states; and 18/19 can't legally drink in most states... Personal education and such aren't taught in most schools, and certainly isn't required either. Also bankers KNEW that the 08 recession was gonna happen eventually, it was dead predictable when they give out hundreds/thousands of mortgages to people who certainly cant pay them off. How the F were students supposed to see it coming for people going to school in the years of like 04-09?   And what about the students of say 2016-NOW? People going for 4/5 year bachelors degrees, graduated into THIS PANDEMIC which is very arguably the worst pandemic since the black plague centuries ago... Like we're in 22... and you can go back as far as like '04 so 18 YEARS AGO... and in that time frame there's only been like one decent stretch of time for graduates. 

Also of your australian solutions... Our student loans are also through the government. Yeah limiting college pricing would be good, but would do nothing to help tons of those already screwed over by one of the worst recessions we've had in like half a century and the worst pandemic we've had since the PLAGUE... Same for the income based repayments. 

And so you're not okay with forgiveness, but you're okay with forgiveness after X amount of time?

and lastly 

>Certainly as many have said a good start is to just set interest to 0%. But we need a system wide ""permanent"" fix.

This requires CONGRESS. 

Which sadly is a 50-50 senate of deadlock. 

Forgiving the loans is a start for now; which BIDEN CAMPAIGNED ON. He can do through executive action. Afterwards hopefully somehow someway maybe the D's will do okay in midterms in the senate atleast things don't look too terrible; and then maybe something can be done for the future."

I say that‚Äôs his loss.
   
Societal norms, even in 2022, favor a man in a heterosexual partnership being the primary breadwinner and advise men to steer clear from entering relationships where they might be second or third in a woman‚Äôs priorities. There‚Äôs research and articles written warning men against marrying a ‚Äúcareer woman‚Äù because he‚Äôll find that she won‚Äôt be happy quitting her job and staying at home, the house will be dirtier, he‚Äôs more likely to fall ill, and there‚Äôs a high likelihood that marrying a career woman will result in divorce.
   
Damn right it will. If a man needs me to stay home, clean the house, and prevent him from falling ill, you better believe I‚Äôm filing for divorce.
   
But all of that talk aside, being a single woman running for office does come with some hardships. I recently spoke with another woman who already holds public office. She used to hold very similar views to marriage and ran for office as a single woman. However, she recently decided to get married because she said she needed emotional support. She said that being a woman in politics and running outside of a political machine can be incredibly lonely.

The California Supreme Court ruled over a century ago that instructing juries that a defendant had a duty to retreat before being justified in the use of self-defense was a violation of a citizen's civil right to self-defense. Since then, many other states have followed suit, overturning laws requiring a duty to retreat.

Also, California's stand-your-ground right applies in public and has nothing to do with castle doctrine. When in your home, Californians have the statutory rights to shoot any non-resident who forcibly enters the home or attempts to enter.

Also, you are wrong about Oregon.  In 2007, in *Oregon v. Sandoval*, Oregon's courts followed California and ruled that the duty to retreat was unconstitutional. Juries in Oregon cannot be instructed that someone had a duty to retreat in a self-defense case.

In fact, most states have followed California in either overturning duty to retreat language in the courts or in passing civil rights legislation confirming the human right to stand your ground and not retreat. Only a handful of states, mostly in the New England area, still have a duty to retreat. I believe it's maybe less than a dozen that still have a duty to retreat."

6661,"hxz2fag",1,0,"/r/politics","That person isn‚Äôt trans. And I‚Äôm more worried about politicians in restrooms. Let‚Äôs do the math: 

https://www.transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/USTS-Full-Report-FINAL.PDF

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Trans Women (MTF) make up only 32% of the total transgender population. The rest are Trans Men, Non-binary, etc. (p.44)
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Out of the Surveyed Trans Women, only 68% have already transitioned. The rest are either still questioning or planning on transitioning some day. (p.47)
‚Ä¢	‚Å†53% of trans women ""sometimes or always"" avoid public restrooms (p.228)

Let's assume that the trans women who have already transitioned but never avoid public restrooms are using women's restrooms on a regular basis.

1.4 million * 32% * 68% * 47% = ~143,181 trans women using the women's restrooms on a regular basis.

143,181 trans women / 4100 Senators = 34.9 times as many trans women regularly using the women's restrooms as there have ever been Senators

Let's also remember that ""Trans woman committing sexual assault in a restroom"" is also an incredibly rare crime. Let's highball the number and say that a dozen instances of this crime have occurred (I'd be surprised if it was even half that, though).

Also, to make things easier, I'm going to count all 12,415 people who have ever served in Congress including the House and the Senate, plus the 18 presidents who have never served in Congress. So 12,433 in total

Source: https://history.house.gov/Institution/Total-Members/Total-Members/#:~:text=Since%20the%20U.S.%20Congress%20convened,with%20service%20in%20both%20chambers.

Let's look at the Wikipedia list of Federal Political Sex Scandals. While not all political sex scandals were cases of sexual assault perse, let's assume that the amount of politicans who are serial offenders (Donald Trump for example) and the amount of unrecorded cases of federal politicians committing sexual assault makes up that.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_federal_political_sex_scandals_in_the_United_States

92 according to this page. I know it's not a perfect number, but the true number would be impossible to obtain so this is the closest I think we can get.

12 highball estimate for bathroom sexual assault / 143,181 trans women =

A trans woman using the women's restroom on a regular basis has, at maximum, a 0.008381% chance of ever committing sexual assault in a women's restroom

92 federal political sex scandals / 12,433 federal politicians =

A Senator, House Member, or President has a 0.74% chance of having a federal political sex scandal, and we're assuming that the total amount of sex assault in this demographic is more or less the same as that number.

(Thinking about it, this might even be a low-ball estimate)

**Meaning Members of Congress and Presidents are approx. 88 times more dangerous than trans women in restrooms.**"

Trump brought on Manafort to launder more money for Russia through the NRA / DB and feed the Trump and GOP pocket book after his campaign went belly up. Putin paid Manafort, Putin paid Giuliani's Ukraine trip to get dirt on Bidens. Rudy got the ambassador to Ukraine fired.

Trump was afraid of the Mueller investigation because.. obviously.. so he brought in Barr. Meanwhile he sued up to the SCOTUS to block access to DB records. Barr also protected Rudy.

That's before we even get into the tie between DB and SCOTUS justice Kennedy, or Trump's push to allow Crimea to be Putin's so he could build his hotel in Yalta, or even Trump's push to weaken sanctions on Russia - that Republicans had to codify in order to prevent.

He makes an interesting argument that I find pretty compelling and seems to explain at least some of the resentment politics we see growing now, especially among the right.  

We are placed in a society where those who are not educated are often not seen as valued.   We place high value on those that get highly educated but the flip side of this is low value gets placed on those that are not.  Those that do well are seen as fully deserving of that success with the implication being that those that do not do well are also fully deserving of that non-success.

Then comes along a leader who panders to those non-elites by suggesting it is the fault of others for their lack of success.  Usually the arguments are ones we all have heard -  It is the fault of immigrants, it is the fault of liberal elites, etc...

The ideal solution would be to shift the notion of value in society and increase the baseline dignity across all groups in society. Granted this is likely very hard because those that are well educated and successful are generally not willing to accept a shift in values either as it would come with a concession that they are where they are mostly due to luck - otherwise there would be no argument for a shift (if you feel you ""deserve"" your success and it is not due to mostly luck, you will not want to shift these notions).

So instead, a populist like Trump comes along and panders to that resentment.  We can say that Trump sounds like an uneducated idiot, so the uneducated will follow him but it goes deeper than that.  I think it is also the case he also gives them a sense of value and dignity that they aren't getting from the rest of society that makes them feel unvalued."

What drives the average voter to the poll are issues democrats are currently struggling with -- inflation, COVID policies at schools, in-person schooling, a rise in violent crime and theft and healthcare.

That's the point. They'd be able to actually invest in something that builds them long-term and familial wealth. They'd actually be able to start families without worry of not being able to provide.

My point is that it's a two-pronged problem that requires 2 things to solve it. The cancellation of student debt, even if it's just a portion of it, and an expansion of public funding to include at least an associate's degree to make it free at the point of service. That way, once at least an associate's is obtained,  newly graduated individuals can actually start their lives. They can buy a house, they can start a family. Of course that's gonna be debt on them, but it's for an investment they can actually pass on to the next generation. You can't pass your years of education to your next of kin. But you can pass a house to them. And in this country, what you own is everything. A house is always viewed as a sound investment because it's viewed as a sign of upward mobility.

Also to this point 

> You say that $300/mo isn't ""that much"", but it can be all the difference.

Trust me, I understand it can make a difference. I've lived very frugally because I have to. So any amount extra is helpful. But I shouldn't have to live that frugally. No one should have to live like that. That extra $$ should just be a given since the gap between a HS diploma and an associates degree isn't that large despite the cost associated with the associate's degree. 

The point I was trying to make was that that $300 isn't enough to make a **substantial** difference in a person's life. I've lived that difference, I know firsthand. That extra $300 isn't going to lift the burdens anyone has. Sure I might feel a bit of relief, but it isn't going to make any substantial difference.

The other party are against governing, against democracy, and against rule of law. Their ethos is based on power by any means, at any cost, by means of populism via hostile regressivism.  The grift is the centerpiece of it all.  

There's just no comparison.  This is not a ""both sides"" thing.

**stolen valor** he lied about becoming a Marine, he lied about being admitted to the naval academy, and he admitted to this lie under oath during a lawsuit implicating his insurance company. Source: https://politicalwire.com/2020/08/11/gop-candidate-was-rejected-from-naval-academy/

**sexual assault** in the one semester he spent in college (at one of the most ultra conservative college in America) before dropping out due to having straight Ds (his own admission), he was accused of sexual assault by a dozen women, in a letter signed by over 150 former classmates who corroborated the victim‚Äôs accounts, which represents almost 50% of the entire student body of Patrick Henry College. It was so bad and brazen that RAs and staff would warn female students to never be alone with him, and never get in his car. Source: https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/addybaird/madison-cawthorn-sexual-misconduct-allegations-patrick

**white supremacy** he accused a political opponent of ‚Äúleaving his career in Boston to go work for non-whites‚Äù. Like, he wrote that, on his website, as an insult. As a way to discredit someone. He later said the words were ‚Äútaken out of context‚Äù and it was a ‚Äúsyntax error‚Äù. The name of his shell company is ‚ÄúSPQR Holdings‚Äù, and SPQR, although a historical acronym with Roman roots, has been appropriated by white supremacist groups in recent years. sources: https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/republican-house-candidate-s-website-attacks-critic-going-work-non-n1244531

**lying about Paralympics training** he lied about training for the olympics by pretending he was actually on the verge of cracking the track and field Paralympic team. He posted all these insane videos where he talks about being obsessed with breaking the 100m world record, like he actually has a chance of breaking it. I could post videos online telling the world I‚Äôm obsessed with running a sub 2 hour marathon, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs a real thing... Source: https://www.towleroad.com/2021/01/madison-cawthorn-paralympics/

**lying about his career** he has never held a job in his adult life (he worked at a Chick-Fil-A as a teen). He used the insurance payout from his car accident to buy a $20K foreclosed property in Georgia, registered an LLC with 0 employees and $0 top line revenue, and calls himself a ‚Äúreal estate investor‚Äù. Source (I know it‚Äôs the same as above, they cover both topics): https://www.towleroad.com/2021/01/madison-cawthorn-paralympics/

**lying about Harvard and Princeton** ""Cawthorn said in an earlier deposition he was accepted to Princeton and an online program at Harvard, along with other universities.

**Lying about his car accident** He lied in interviews and said he heroically crawled out of a fiery crash and that friend in the car with him left him for dead when in fact his friend dragged him out while he was unconscious. The friend in question has since done many interviews sharing his side of the story. Source: https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/madison-crowther-lies-wheelchair_n_603c5e83c5b6d7794ae01026

**He has the signature of a 7 year old**
Not the most relevant point to expose his predatory behaviour and his racism, but this shit bag misspells his own name, twice, in his signature... https://www.dailydot.com/debug/madison-cawthorn-signature/ ‚Äã

Here are the facts. He is a sexual predator. He is dumb (at a literal level). He is shameless. He is racist. He is the future of the GQP.

**EDIT** a few things to add:

this list is a few months old, I need to update it with some of the following shit he‚Äôs done since I last updated it:
-	threats to fellow Republican congressman that resulted in an ethics violation
-	calls for violence against democrats and liberals
-	multiple instances of bringing weapons at school board meetings
-	bringing a weapon on a plane
-	bringing a weapon in the Capitol
-	getting into a physical altercation with a dead rotten tree"
8215,"hy26j2w",1,0,"/r/politics","It‚Äôs weird so many boomers support this embarrassing loser- he will destroy the Republican Party."
8218,"hy05mz0",1,0,"/r/politics","What exactly is ‚Äúsanctions on sovereign debt‚Äú? Like what does that entail?"
8235,"hxzehj3",1,0,"/r/politics","Mitch McConnell's courts. They screw Trump at every turn (election results, tax returns, J6) while supporting normie conservative principles (religious rights, likely wins for guns and abortion this summer). And while the courts embarrass Trumpy, the J6 committee led by Cheney and Kizinger, two McConnell allies, uncover all of the dark secrets and dirt behind his role in the Capitol Riot and in general over his presidency, leaving him exposed for the DOJ, another Federalist Society graduate that McConnell barred from SCOTUS but got his caucus to wholeheartedly approve for DOJ, to put him away. Hence he didn't vote to convict Trump in the 2nd Impeachment but said that he knew he was responsible for it all and that justice would catch up to him. This is how he does it without having to have his caucus vote against him and alienate their base by being seen to oppose Dear Leader."

8242,"hy23rz4",1,0,"/r/politics","Because they have sucked so much Trump cock, they can't stop. The majority of their voter block has orange lips now. Trump praised Putin nonstop, because Putin has power trump can only jerk off to dreaming about. They have to walk the line trump carved for them or face revolt of the fan base. They milked this cow too long, now the cow owns them.

Edit 1

While this all really started in 94 with Gringrich, it went off the rails in 2007 in the demonizing of Obama. That was when they lost control. That is when the lunatics started running the asylum.

8270,"hy0bntb",1,0,"/r/politics","> Russia invaded separatist territory;

The ""separatists"" are supplied by Russia.  This would be like Mexico supplying arms, troops and propaganda to support the idiots that think Texas should secede from the US, then once those idiots start causing problems Mexico recognizes Texan independence and moves their troops in to ""help out"" before annexing Texas as part of Mexico (again).

Which, before anyone says anything, is basically what happened in the other direction going on 200 years ago when Texas seceded from Mexico, although Texas did spend a brief time as a separate country before joining the US."

Obviously it‚Äôs because the average person has positive associations with those things"
8337,"hy31fwb",1,0,"/r/politics","Trump wanted troops to massacre the peacefjul BLM protesters. 99% of the violence around those protests was actually perped by his Maga January 6th brown shirts, same as the fake trucker rallies. And Fox promotes it all. This is really neo nazism."

8532,"hy48h2v",1,0,"/r/politics","You're absolutely correct. This is something ignorant or anti-intellectual people do. Ignore all nuance, details, and the ugly complexities of reality so that they can have a simple conclusion. 

Some say: ""The devil is in the details."" You could also say: ""The truth is in the details.""

Reality is not simple. It is not black and white. Instead of accepting this and working towards progress by understanding, analyzing, and improving complex systems, some would rather propose ""common sense"" arguments that deal with absolutes because they are easy to digest and even easier to spread.

Telling the truth is difficult, not only because of the complexities, but because there are simply things we do not know.

A common layperson wants to listen to and follow someone who appears resolute and knows exactly what is right/good and what is wrong/bad. The truth is far messier. People don't want to listen to someone that hedges against the unknown or outlines the details that depend on specific circumstances and scenarios. The best we have is the scientific method and other methodical means of assessing data and information to gain insight. But so many despise science and intellectuals for some reason.

I'm absolute terms, a third rate modern power could demolish each those nations at their height. Especially the Romans and Mongolians, who would have no answer for airpower.

Also, in absolute terms, no pre-modern state had the ability to project power globally, for obvious reasons.

In relative terms, each of those nations had peer competitiors that posed a significant threat to them and their interests. For the Romans, the Parthians/Sassanids and the Ethiopian Empire were close by peer competitiors that could (and did!) twart Roman interests. A bit further afield lay the Han Empire and a variety of powers in India, which Rome had neither the logistical capability nor the military power to bring to heel.

For the Mongols, there were the Mamluks, the Vietnamese, the Japanese, and arguably the Hungarians, each of which kept their lands from being added to the Mongolian Empire.

Finally, the British Empire. I'm going to look at the second British Empire at its height, rather than the first British Empire (which was not even the most powerful empire of its day). The second British Empire had at least five rivals: France, Germany, the United States, and Russia, and later Japan, each of which could (and did!) resist the will of the British Empire.

This isn't to say that the above powers weren't incredible and unique, they all were, in different ways. But at no point were they the sole undisputed hyperpower. For a brief bit between the fall of the USSR and 9/11, the United States was.

8865,"hy4ej66",1,0,"/r/politics","In January, the FDA issued a statement about Ambien (the brand name for the drug zolpidem), one of the most popular insomnia medications in the U.S. The agency recommended using lower bedtime doses than we'd previously been prescribing, out of concern that current doses could leave people impaired the next morning. They recommend the cut even for patients who haven't ended up feeling groggy, and especially in women (who don't metabolize the medication as quickly as men). The recommendations also included a warning to insomnia medications in general:

To decrease the potential risk of impairment with all insomnia drugs, health care professionals should prescribe, and patients should take, the lowest dose capable of treating the patient's insomnia.
As doctors debated the merits of these claims, Ambien made the news again last month when a national study reported that the number of emergency department (E.D.) visits related to adverse reactions from Ambien has risen by almost 220% in 5 years:

The number of zolpidem-related E.D. visits involving adverse reactions increased nearly 220 percent from 2005 to 2010.
Females accounted for two thirds of zolpidem-related E.D. visits involving adverse reactions in 2010. Patients over 65 represented one third.
Half of visits involved patients who had combined other medications with zolpidem, including narcotics, anti-anxiety medications, and other insomnia meds.
The most common complaints in these cases were ""daytime drowsiness, dizziness, hallucinations, agitation, sleep-walking and drowsiness while driving."""

9119,"hy3tcz8",1,0,"/r/politics","Global oil economics are horrifically complex.  Anyone who simply points to something like ""We used to export more than we imported, so we were energy independent"" doesn't have the first clue what they are talking about.  The notion that being a net exporter makes you ""energy independent"" belies just how little one understands the global oil market.

First, not all oil is the same. There are four different types of crude (actually about 160 when you get into sub-groups), and those types are used to make different types and qualities of distillates.  For example, light oil can be used for transportation fuels (e.g. petrol) but not much else; heavy crude can be used for many transportation fuels, but also plastics and composites.  

Second, not only do these fuels have different uses, but also they have different prices.  So if you reroute one type of oil for a different type of production, that can have tremendous spillover effects for consumers.  Hard to be ""energy independent"" if, for example, it means the cost of gasoline goes to $6/gallon or you can't pave streets because asphalt isn't available.

Third, there are different types of refineries with different processes to conform to the market needs and regulations of the target market.  They also have to be configured in such a way as to process the type of crude they are receiving. Refineries aren't a simple plug-and-play for different types of oil and different markets.  

Fourth, transportation and logistics is tremendously complicated. We export oil from specific sites to specific destinations because of the cost of transport. This was the entire purpose of the Keystone Pipeline -- it was designed to move crude from Canada down to the Gulf Coast refineries (with some stops along the way) -- but those refineries were then going to export the products to Europe and Latin America.  

The reality is that oil markets are far more complicated than just asking if X - I > 0.  Just because you are a net exporter doesn't mean that you have achieved energy independence."

9600,"hy3stth",1,0,"/r/politics","I‚Äôd like to offer some ‚Äògood case scenario‚Äô analysis, centering around the motives of the players.

So first of all, a large scale invasion won‚Äôt happen. If it does, the sanctions on Russia will be crippling. The trade with Europe will be affected and many American companies have vital interest in them and in the broad European economy. I doubt if anyone wants that to happen at all.

Second of all, let‚Äôs examine the motive of Putin. What does he want? He knows Ukraine is drifting away and at this point it‚Äôs pretty much irreversible. But to safeguard the border, he would have to have some ‚Äòbuffer zone‚Äô. Therefore he orchestrated the ‚Äòindependence‚Äô of these two regions, placing the military around Ukraine as a threat to make sure Ukraine does not respond fiercely. Now that he got the buffer zone he wanted, it‚Äôs doubtful that he is willing to escalate this. Since Ukraine is not In NATO, the NATO will basically just be training and supplying some weapons. It‚Äôs very unlikely that they will venture an incursion into the Donbas region.

Now finally, what does the US want? Why the US is acting like a maniac, almost unilaterally declaring that Russia is going to invade Ukraine like ghengis khan leading his steeds and cover the country with blood? Why it‚Äôs denying any possibility of accepting some of Putin‚Äôs demands as if wanting there to be major conflict? First of all, US wants an unstable and weak Russia. Making the situation bigger will allow the US to come up with more severe sanctions. It can also shake up the ties between European countries and Russia, ensuring that the US‚Äôs dominance will persist (if we ignore China for a second). There is absolutely no way that the US is going to put boots on the ground. But the weapon companies are very happy to sell more weapons, either to the pentagon to donate them or to Eastern European countries who feel threatened by the move. So weaker opponent and profit on the fears, why not?

My guess is that this is Putin‚Äôs multi-year (or even decade) plan to encroach the eastern Ukraine, possibly up to Kyiv. This step will be just like the 2014 Crimea crisis, put a little dent in the market and then it‚Äôs effects will fizzle out."

They had a violent insurrection from the president and they *doubled down* on it, calling it legitimate political discussion. They buy into The Big Lie, and people who are willing to stand up for the truth, like Liz Cheney, are excommunicated. They're trying to rig state election boards and laws so that their state can send false electors when they don't win that state.

This is the furthest thing from politics as usual.

But what are we getting in response? Did Nancy Pelosi write a concerned letter to someone that no one has seen? Have any major justice or election departments raised the alarm on any of those and assured us that this won't stand? Has popular media sources called out this coup, or just pretended like this is all within the normal realm of normal politics?

We're losing our country and no one is even putting up a fight. We're just going down quietly. People are going to look at history books in 20, 30, 50 years and wonder what the hell happened and how we let it happen."

One gave me some quick whiplash, in broken english it basically said, ""We are all brothers and we should not be spilling each other's blood!"". Well said!

Any other understanding is sheer and utter ignorance that breaks with the conventions of geopolitics and is a half hearted attempt at continuing the chain of disinformation propaganda that America is well known for.

There was always an underwritten handshake between Slavic countries but that's now been interfered with by pro western propaganda. The line in the sand was drawn however when America tried to start a coup to overthrow a democratically elected pro-Russian government in Ukraine (and yeah there were American fingerprints all over it).

In 2014 Russia did what it had to do to maintain the Kerch Strait from being affected and thus keeping it open... Otherwise, if that channel was blocked Russia would lose its access to Europe by sea...

You can't be so stupid that you think Russia would willing give up access to its Black Sea Ports to Western interests? Because my answer to you with regard to that question (which is the most significant one being asked) is not in a million years...

And I don't care how self important you feel as an American, that's always going to be the answer and if you don't understand the problem with not keeping the Kerch Strait open to everyone including Russia, then you don't understand the problem at all.

One of us has a literal IR qualification and understands the problem and it's not you.

Since we do not have that, i cant wrap my head around how a stripper gonna assist with not only lawmaking but actually lobbying for laws that protect her voters. Perhaps she is lobbying for sex workers but it does seem she is just a general wannabe electee to gov.

I think we as voters should be considerate on backgrounds of people to be aligned with our objectives, e.g. if we wanna have Mars settled by 2030, perhaps electing astronomy professor/ spaceman might be beneficial, instead of a televangelist or a mormon.

He talked about structural economic issues in addition to just front line stuff like raising the minimum wage eg infrastructure, jobs, Which are also not necessarily in progressives‚Äô wheelhouse.

If people want to push the Democrats to the left, these things need to happen:

1) Democratic politicians need to feel secure that passing laws for left-leaning priorities will get them reelected, not voted out.

2) They need to feel like running left will not cost them in a general election.

3) They need to feel that the real threat to staying in office is that they will lose a primary challenge from the left.

This is exactly the mechanism by which the Republican party moved to the right, because Republicans in congress aren't afraid of general elections, they're afraid of a primary challenge from the right.

10162,"hy2u5nn",1,0,"/r/politics","They are playing this politically - aka Putin is a genius in the sense that he ""outsmarted"" Biden.

This kind of comment is actually about domestic politics and not about Putin at all. Remember Trump's base has isolationist and nationalist tendencies and don't tend to care morally what other countries do, except in the sense of how they can use it to gain domestic influence.

Also calling someone a genius is not the same as calling them morally right. An evil genius is still a genius.

Later in the same rambling speech Trump claims to have told Putin he wasn't allowed to invade Ukraine while Trump was president, so from the speech in context he doesn't seem to be saying he approves of the invasion, only that the way Putin pulled it off was smart.

He additionally criticized Biden's sanctions for not being strong enough. Calling them ""no response"" sanctions."

If he'd been a smarter man, he likely wouldn't have run for office at all, because he would have known how much scrutiny it would have put on his shady dealings.  He would have been content to make money and manipulate things behind the scenes like the Koch brothers instead.

But if he had been elected, you're right that he would have been more like Bush Jr, because he would have had a basic understanding of what was allowed to say and do.  People want to credit Trump for being bold for the things he does, but it's really because he's stupid.  He's like the drunken idiots on *Cops* who incriminate themselves on camera while thinking they are winning the argument. The reason Trump has gotten away with it so far is because of the failure of our system, not because he's clever."

I agree that people's selfish and ignorant views helped spread COVID. We should've masked up and helped prevent the it from spreading further. The part where I do not agree with the left is the vaccination mandates. 
You are a sovereign individual. Meaning the govt has domain up to a certain point. They can tell you where you cannot go. What you can't do. Etc. But their domain ends where my body is.

Germany:
CDS/CDU - Centre-Right - Nationalist, Theocratic, Opposed Same-Sex Marriage as recent as 2017

The Centre Party - Centre to Centre-Right - Helped Hitler's rise to power, has been relegated to local elections but as they have been absorbing people from the far-right, they have been gaining more power.

The UK:
Boris Johnson

Sweden:
Moderata Samlingspartiet - Centre-Right - Anti-immigration, pro-privitization, anti-regulation, and want compulsory military service.

If you‚Äôre discussing the *circumstances* surrounding when a person is allowed to use deadly force to protect herself, the only thing which really changes is the most trivial.  In practice, the line between ‚ÄúI was in fear for my life‚Äù and ‚ÄúI was in fear for my life and did not think I could get away‚Äù is very, *very* thin in a courtroom.

Don‚Äôt believe me?  Look at the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse: the judge ruled that none of the ~~crimes Rittenhouse committed~~ ‚Äúcircumstances‚Äù leading up to the shootings mattered, only whether Rittenhouse was reasonably in fear of his life at the moment he pulled the trigger.  Wisconsin does not have SYG.  Wisconsin‚Äôs deadly force law includes the threat of grievous bodily harm (meaning his brandishing a rifle could be considered deadly force in and of itself).  Wisconsin‚Äôs deadly force laws specifically prohibit the use of deadly force to defend property which does not belong to to the defender.  Wisconsin‚Äôs deadly force law specifically invalidates the use of deadly force if the need for it is prompted by the commission of a crime.  *None of that mattered*.

Side note: if it seems like the judge simply disregarded the laws of his own state to stack the deck in favor of the defendant, I wholeheartedly agree with you.  I‚Äôm still salty over that case‚Äîbut‚Ä¶point remains.

So if you‚Äôre arguing that SYG changes the *circumstances* by which deadly force is justified, you‚Äôre making bad assumptions, and you need to revisit your thinking."

What I'm arguing against is forgiving loans without changing the system to, at a minimum, prevent similar debt in the future.  More free education would be a bonus that I would support.

Even by your own math, the numbers don't dispute what I'm saying.  You say that $300/mo isn't ""that much"", but it can be all the difference.  It can be the difference between having a car and not.  It can be the difference between having various utilities, and not.  It can be the difference between being able to afford a much needed vacation, and not.  It is even the difference between being able to save for retirement, thus being able to retire, and not.  That's huge, and that's pretty much the smallest difference.  Compare that to a 4 year degree and now you're $500 more per month.  

If someone offered me 130k over 40 years, but I'd have to pay 40k back over the same time period, it would be a no brainer.  This isn't mass hysteria.  If the math didn't work out and it didn't pay off for the vast majority of people, they wouldn't do it.

This all ignores the likelihood that the vast majority of these people asking for student debt forgiveness, wouldn't just be debt free anymore.  They'd be taking that money and putting it towards some other investment.  Instead of struggling because their student loans are suffocating them, now it's their mortgage...or whatever else they'd put it towards."

Eh they have often said this, but even the 1950s had plenty of things they'd dislike going by their standards today. The average 1950s Republican had more respect for government, for law, for science/academics, etc...

The 1950s American suburbanite may have held *some* of the same socially conservative beliefs as modern Republicans but they also plenty that would be down right progressive in comparison.

Joe Manchin is more willing to cooperate with Mitch McConnell (and I would add Pelosi, Sinema, Schumer and Biden into that equation) than he is with Ocasio Cortez.  Meanwhile McConnell, Collins and Romney have no problem cooperating with \[Lord Dampnut\], Ted Cruz or Jim Jordan.  Occasionally they part ways rhetorically, and throw out a few token votes on impeachment or judges (oddly never enough to change course or block the agenda), but besides short of physically and legislatively participating in an armed insurrection against the United States, they haven't served as a check on the GQP agenda.
