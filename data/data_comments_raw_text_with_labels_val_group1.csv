The willingness of Canadians to seemingly happily grant this sort of power to a central authority, for a non-emergency, is terrifying to those of us with an already low degree of trust in federal government in the US. It's too close to home not just in proximity, but in values.

Think about the fact that a group of peaceful protestors, exercising their right to protest (can argue about blocking roadways for sure), entirely peaceful, was demonized as some evil white supremecist, Nazi movement.  They were protesting government tyranny and then put down by some questionably exercised emergency powers (aka ramped up government tyranny).  Further anyone is at risk if having private funds frozen.  That is disabling someone's ability to function at all in society.

Probably a decade or two at least away from that but I don’t see how that’s not the logical next step.

It's literally an obstacle to left's designs for the future for minorities to achieve success and for there to be harmonious race relations. They don't actually want that. They need a constant underclass and a constant stream of class warfare to justify their positions. So they create the very problem that they offer the solutions to, and the solutions are always thinly-veiled authoritarian power grabs.

They always need a fake moral cause in order to validate their authoritarianism. It's always about increasing government power and stripping people of their rights. Authoritarianism is the actual goal of every single leftist talking point, about every single issue. Economics, health care, race relations, and environmental issues. People can note that every time the left has a plan to tackle a problem that is the flavor of the week, the plan basically amounts to stripping people of their rights, increasing government control, limiting national sovereignty, and achieving a laundry list from a globalists' most deranged imaginings. 

Back to race though, just about every lingering social problem that black people face specifically in the US is a result of decades of Democrat policies and left-wing ideology being spread in academia, in the media, and in pop culture. Any law, policy, or economic development that actually improves the condition of black people in the US long-term is vehemently opposed by Democrats. 

Before the pandemic, Trump's policies resulted in record low unemployment in every single racial group in the US, energy independence for the US, rabid wage growth, and a huge surge in entrepreneurial success in black communities. This was the result of tax cuts and loosening regulations. The entire opposition that Trump faced by Democrats revolves around their fear of the fact that his policies would give minorities in the US a taste of economic success that didn't depend on Democrat-implemented government handouts."

It's something that confuses the pro-abortion crowd because in their eyes it's hypocritical and in a way I find it hard to disagree unless we attach an asterisk that says life matters -if you're a US citizen.

Now I fully understand America can't fix the problems of every child on the planet and ""for the children!"" can be abused but as a society we fight harder for the rights of the unborn then we do for the quality of their lives once born. Born to a mom who didn't want you or can't love you, born into poverty, born deformed or mentally handicapped as a product of incest, tough luck kid try harder next birth?

I realize that I hit all the cliche's there but millions of living breathing kids are going through hell every single day and I wish we as a society fought as hard for them as some do for the ones that are ended in the womb before consciousness or a central nervous system was fully developed as the later seems far more merciful."

What Democrats have learned is they can push their political wet dreams every time they get power and it makes little difference on the shift in power. 

Obama came into office with a super majority. Democrats pushed Financial reform for a problem they created that no one asked for. They pushed climate change which wasn't even a top 10 issue for Americans. And they pushed healthcare reform which wasn't even a top 20 issue for Americans.

All of them far left stances and not even a decade later they regained control of Congress and then the presidency. So called moderates just shifted left with them as it became the new ""normal"".

But to make your stance even worse. Even with a popular Reaganesque president, the Pendulum *still swings*. Reagan was hampered by having a fully Democrat House and Senate for 6 of his 8 years in office. Meaning that if Republicans wait to tackle the issue they will *never* tackle the issue.

This applies to conservative issues across the board, not just abortion. If Republicans are not willing to implement real and meaningful reforms while in power they have squandered their capacity to do so. It's less a conservative party (American sense of word, not European) and more a status quo Party. As in no one can ever expect Republicans to do anything."

The US already has a bunch of sanctions, that were put in under Obama. Their impact has been counterproductive. Russia is much less dependent on the west because of it, and worse, built closer links to China to withstand future sanctions. End result, China has also become stronger. More sanctions would have just pissed off more allies.

The same arguments against Nordstream 2 were used for Nordstream 1. They turned out to be BS. (Basically Russia used to supply gas to EU through Poland and Ukraine. Ukraine used to steal gas whenever it was having issues. After Nordstream 1 they could bypass Ukraine and Poland if they wanted. Sucks for Ukraine and Poland, but great for the rest of Europe. Nordstream 2 extends the pipleline.)

The bottom line is countries want to do business with Russia. They **want** cheap Russian gas.  If they wanted to reduce Russian gas consumption, they would have done so. They don't care about Ukraine. Germany may not certify Nordstream 2 now, but that's because the winter is nearly over, and they get gas in any case through Nordstream 1. If next winter is cold, they will quietly turn on Nordstream 2 as well.

US sanctions cause pain to other countries, because the US controls a lot of the financial systems (in particular SWIFT).

(for background https://fee.org/articles/swift-and-the-weaponization-of-the-us-dollar/ )


Countries do not like pain. They use systems that the US has control over because they are convenient. At some point they will switch over to systems that the US has no control over. They are already looking. This just increases the incentives to switch.

At the end of the day, a large part of US prosperity is because the rest of the world uses the dollar system to trade. If the rest of the world decides that it is no longer worth using US systems for trade, the US will suffer greatly."

For any folks who don't know, in Canada the reigning party can call elections at any time by claiming a vote to pass a bill is also a confidence vote in the government's leadership. If the government loses the confidence of the house, an election is called.

It's a sad example of how democracy is often wielded as a threat in Canada because the ruling party knows that voters don't like being forced to return to the polls more often than needed.

2550,"hxwb4d3",1,1,"/r/Conservative","That's not how British style parliaments work.  Each constituency has a MP elected to parliament.  If your party (or an alliance of parties) can hold a majority of seats, you get to fill the executive ministry positions and dictate how laws are applied and conduct foreign diplomacy.

At any point, if a majority of MPs  feel they don't like how things are going in government, they can have a vote of no confidence.  Major pieces of legislature are often seen as confidence bills. Because if the ruling party can't pass important legislature, then why are they running things?  If the ruling party fails to win enough votes in a confidence vote then elections are triggered and hopefully the next group of MPs can get it sorted out. 

For context, they had an election last year.  Also elections are expensive so if your party is still in debt financing the last election, you might not want new elections.  Doubly so if you are a small minority party in alliance with the ruling party who doesn't have a majority in parliament."

The same people who call the riots of 2020 that caused billions in damages, dozens of lives lost and thousands hurt, are the same people calling the trucker convoy an attack on democracy. And won't shut up about the Jan 6 protest. 

The same people who say that Aaron Danielson(Oregon) shouldn't have been there if he wanted to still be alive and that the PeAcEfUl protestor must've feared for his life, yet say Rittenhouse who very clearly defended himself, shouldn't have deserved to because the peaceful protests are for social justice and if you're protesting that, you're against democracy.

2697,"hy1blrw",1,1,"/r/Conservative","My opinion that the US should use every trick and advantage to get ahead in geopolitics is just as irrelevant as your opinion that we shouldn’t meddle in other countries affairs if it brings advantages to us. 

Diplomacy and geopolitics is not exactly a game where everyone plays fair and is expected to get along. Everyone is out for their own interests as states and they will use whatever advantages they can to get ahead. It is very machiavellian, but it comes down to basic human nature. That is how diplomacy has always been conducted, the issue is when diplomacy fails and leads to war. 

If anything when everyone is out for themselves it makes diplomacy far easier because you can more reasonably expect what the person on the other side of the table wants and will do instead of like the EU where you might be talking to a German, but are dealing with some issue about Greece or just the collective overall.

Also so you are saying the two breakaway republics should have self determination, what about the rest of Ukraine who still consider those two areas integral parts of their nation? Do their opinions and understanding of their country not matter? Only those break away republics and Russia’s?

Also the Bill of Rights and our Constitution apply directly to the formation of the US government and the inalienable God given rights our federal government recognizes we intrinsically have and cannot suppress. It has nothing to do with diplomacy and dealing with other countries. But I agree if other countries had Bill of Rights and our constitution/governmental system it would be a better world overall."

Therefore, of course his policies reflected an America First attitude except in foreign matters that benefited the US. For example, look at Taiwan. They are one of the largest exports of technology (microchips) to the U.S. in addition to supplying the US with large amounts of industrial goods (tools and fasteners). So, knowing the effective impact on the US, Trump took a hardline approach to China on protecting trade routes with freedom of navigation drills supporting their sovereignty (without fully recognizing it diplomatically and causing hard issues with China) and supplying their military.  Ukraine offers little value to the US in terms of export goods and the such, but are important in Europe’s geopolitics and securing the pipelines that extend through Ukraine. That’s exactly why Trump supported European countries taking an active role in their militaries and having them stand up to big brother Russia. He supported them, but didn’t get us needlessly involved in European politics that could have had lasting implications for the US.  As someone else stated, the Biden Administration has largely been engaging in saber rattling because the U.S. has very little to gain from the Ukrainian conflict since they aren’t a NATO ally, don’t provide many exports to the US, and aren’t really a part of US military strategy."

So putting those things together, the current Conservative party has absolutely failed.

If they choose to forgo medical treatment(the vaccine), then that's their right but they should stay home if they get severe COVID because they made their choice to forgo medical treatment when they didn't get vaccinated.

Frome the article:

Beloved host and advocate for blue-collar workers Mike Rowe explained in December the real meaning behind the highly-popularized, “clever,” and “hysterical” chant.

“The times that we’re living in right now are forcing lots of people on both sides of the aisle to look at a thing, or hear a thing, and be told that what they’re seeing and what they’re hearing is not real,” Rowe said. “And you can’t do that to people indefinitely and expect them not to push back somehow. You can’t tell people that the border is secure and then show them images of tens of thousands of people flooding over it. You can’t tell people that the evacuation of Afghanistan was a success and then show them people falling off of a plane. … And you can’t ask people who are watching a NASCAR race at home, who clearly hear the crowd yelling ‘F*** Joe Biden’ to pretend that what they’re really hearing is ‘Let’s Go Brandon.’”

“I think what’s happened is people have just become sick and tired of being told that what they’re seeing and what they’re hearing is not what they’re seeing and hearing,” Rowe emphasized.

“And this is the perfect trope,” he continued. “I don’t think people who yell it are necessarily enemies of the president. I think they’re enemies of being told that what they’re seeing and what they’re hearing isn’t real, that it’s somehow a figment of their imagination. People are sick of that.”"

Allow people to assume their own risks and decide what actions that they want to take. 

I don’t ridicule those who wear masks. That is their decision. I also don’t scream at those who don’t wear masks-that is their decision.

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, on the other hand, has been actively combating disease in areas that need help.

This wikipedia page has tables detailing projects in various countries, along with timeframes and costs. It's under the ""Activities"" tab.

Under Global Health Division, it's stated that the foundation teamed up with several international govt teams to begin a joint pandemic response plan.

This lead to the pandemic response plan Obama left behind, which was discarded by the Trump administration.

In 2020, Gates Foundation donated over $150 million to Covid relief efforts, as opposed to $55 million by Novo."

>What similarities do you actually see?

One of the first things Hitler did was pass the [Reichstag Fire Decree](https://www.ushmm.org/learn/timeline-of-events/1933-1938/reichstag-fire-decree).
It was passed in response to an emergency declaration, the reichstag fire, and was justified by Hindenburg as ""for the Protection of People and the Reich.""  They used it to outlaw protests by their political opponents and even put them in the first camps.  

The COVID mandates and restrictions follow the same thought.  Punishing people for breaking restrictions meant to ""keep people and Canada safe"". Even putting some in prison.


Invoking the emergency powers act for the first time in history to put down a non-violent protest.  That allowed them to basically do what they wanted and resulted in the seizure of property, freezing of funds, and disregard for life when the RCMP trampled people with their horses.  A lot of them will probably spend time in jail simply for protesting their government.  They even threatened people who donated to the protest.

He believes this because from our side he's heard voices pleading for ""peace at any price"" or ""better Red than dead,"" or as one commentator put it, he'd rather ""live on his knees than die on his feet.""

4219,"hy0fdgf",1,1,"/r/Conservative","Obviously, no two situations are 100% the same, but Hitler's claims to Sudetenland, Danzig, and Anschluss were actually far more reasonable than Putin threatening to invade the whole of Ukraine. The original sin that led to WWII was the oppressive, punitive Treaty of Versailles that directly led to the rise of Hitler through democratic means. Millions of Germans were left stranded in Sudetenland and Danzig and forced to live under foreign rules in the interwar period. The tragedy repeated itself post-WWII when as many as [2.5 million Germans died and 14.6 million were ethnically cleansed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_and_expulsion_of_Germans_(1944%E2%80%931950)). Even Anschluss made sense because Austria and Prussia (founder of German Empire aka Second Reich) were the leading states of the predominantly German-speaking Holy Roman Empire (aka First Reich). The forced abdications of both the Habsburgs and Hohenzollerns (Kaiser Wilhelm II) removed the 2 countries' royalists from the equation.

Putin's 2014 annexation of Crimea at least could be justified on ethnic ground and self-determination as Crimea had a Russian majority and voted to unite with Russia. Even Donetsk could be justified on similar grounds. But Ukrainians have never been Russians, so invading the entire Ukraine is blatant empire building. Just like Hitler lost his moral high ground when he invaded the entire Czechoslovakia. There was a reason the USSR downplayed race, but rather strictly focused on the communist ideology. They knew pushing a Russian chauvinist narrative would immediately lead to ethnic tensions and never-ending civil wars, just like Yugoslavia immediately collapsed when they replaced communism with Serbian chauvinism post-Cold War. Heck, many of the most prominent Soviet Union leaders were not even Russians. Stalin was Georgian. Khruschev was Ukrainian. Trotsky was Jewish (Tito was not a Serb either. He was born to a Croat father and Slovene mother). Having ethnic minority as leaders reinforced the idea that these communist states were ""color-blind,"" which was what held them together."

Poland and the Baltic countries have been the only European countries to sound the alarm and make plans to counter a resurgent Russia. 

2. By allowing Nord Stream 1 and 2 it puts Europe’s largest economy at the mercy of what could possibly be a near term enemy in Russia. Russia could use those pipelines to blackmail and or strangle Germany’s economy which in turn strangles Germany’s military. 

3. Russia has refused to join the “Western” world in economic and military pacts despite joint military exercises, diplomatic and economic exchanges. They always site and have used the excuse of a “security” threat along their western borders to attempt to reestablish the old Soviet buffer.  

4. The U.S. under Trump wanted to untangle itself from foreign wars. He saw the long term plan of Russia. Russia by allying itself with China and refusing to join Western Europe, showed that Putin has no interest in security but only reestablishing or attempting to reestablish the Soviet Union. By Germany allowing the Nord Stream Pipelines, it meant Germany would be at the mercy of an aggressive Russia which means the U.S. would have to stay in Europe to protect the weak Europeans.

It is concerning but we need to avoid going to war over this. Focus on developing and strengthening our own military. Contribute with installations of anti missile systems in Europe. Force Europe to pick up it's fair share of defense by making it clear the us will not serve as their police, etc. 

I have not advocated for ignoring this or making this a nothing burger. I advocate against any intervention. If there were any statement, I would make it on the importance of sovereign states controlling their borders  I am not even sure a rebuke a this point is worth it. Self determination is a fundamental human right. There is no 'right' for the nation of Ukraine to control those territories. Governments only have sovereignty over a territory insofar as the *actual* people in that territory support that government. That is a fundamental stance undertaken by our very foundational documents... The British loyalists argued that Britain has control over the colonies by law and that this legitimated their continued presence in modern day america.

You can 100% protest anything you like but you cannot infringe upon the rights of others! Nothing is going to be achieved by the convoy protests either, not unless the US lifts their vaccine mandates for Canadian truckers which is not going to happen! 

Just so we are clear, SOME truckers protested a mandate (there is a 90% vaccination rate for truckers). Just because you protest doesn’t mean the government needs to address the issue. I’m indigenous and we’ve protested countless times and have been ignored but we don’t bitch and complain that the government is authoritarian.

Daniel Miessler describes Rubin as ""behaving exactly like a liberal with a severe case of PTSD,"" and there is a lot of truth to that. (It also describes people like Joe Rogan, a classical liberal whom the left is leaving far behind as they push and shove to a progressive extreme.)

**Classical liberals** were committed to stripping the church and state of their centralized authoritarian power and dispersing it into the hands of a free people, arguing for individual secular freedom instead of centralized authority like unelected monarchs. Out of this root grew branches that would lead to **progressives** on the one hand and **conservatives** on the other, two branches sharing the same trunk in common.

In other words, someone identifying as a ""liberal"" doesn't necessarily indicate whether they are progressive or conservative; they could be either one. A *progressive* liberal believes in using a democratically elected government to facilitate or force progress, whereas a *conservative* liberal believes that government should conserve the social and economic integrity and norms of a free society that is left alone as much as possible.

Just for the sake of interest, Miessler does [a nice breakdown of the classical liberals](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/a-visual-breakdown-of-intellectual-dark-web-idw-political-positions/) in the intellectual dark web (such as Rubin, Same Harris, Rogan, etc.) and where they sit on the progressive to conservative scale.

Our government has totally used Covid as a political tool. Covid is serious, but it isn’t the be-all and end-all of existence. For some, Covid is life-threatening.  The one thing that I have observed about Covid is that it often acts faster than other viruses.

One thing that I noticed by those who had complications with Covid was a quick and suddenly drop in blood oxygen levels. Immediate attention can be the difference between life and death.

Personal education and such aren't taught in most schools, and certainly isn't required either. Also bankers KNEW that the 08 recession was gonna happen eventually, it was dead predictable when they give out hundreds/thousands of mortgages to people who certainly cant pay them off. How the F were students supposed to see it coming for people going to school in the years of like 04-09?   And what about the students of say 2016-NOW?

Like we're in 22... and you can go back as far as like '04 so 18 YEARS AGO... and in that time frame there's only been like one decent stretch of time for graduates. 

Also of your australian solutions... Our student loans are also through the government.

""I’m an unmarried single woman running for office in the United States. Researchers say that while my bold run for PA-03 may be applauded on the career-front, I’m hurting my chances of finding a long-term partner to settle down with.
   
I say that’s his loss.
   
Societal norms, even in 2022, favor a man in a heterosexual partnership being the primary breadwinner and advise men to steer clear from entering relationships where they might be second or third in a woman’s priorities. There’s research and articles written warning men against marrying a “career woman” because he’ll find that she won’t be happy quitting her job and staying at home, the house will be dirtier, he’s more likely to fall ill, and there’s a high likelihood that marrying a career woman will result in divorce.
   
Damn right it will. If a man needs me to stay home, clean the house, and prevent him from falling ill, you better believe I’m filing for divorce.
   
But all of that talk aside, being a single woman running for office does come with some hardships. I recently spoke with another woman who already holds public office. She used to hold very similar views to marriage and ran for office as a single woman. However, she recently decided to get married because she said she needed emotional support. She said that being a woman in politics and running outside of a political machine can be incredibly lonely.
   
I might be single, but this race is not without love. I deeply love the people of this district. When I leave Philadelphia for a business trip or vacation and I catch sight of Philly’s skyline upon my return, my heart starts beating faster. I know that within the city limits are everyday people going about their waking hours, showing up for one another, building community. I also know that those same people are facing a lot of undeserved and unjust struggle. This is what has propelled me to run such a difficult race in such a toxic environment.

The California Supreme Court ruled over a century ago that instructing juries that a defendant had a duty to retreat before being justified in the use of self-defense was a violation of a citizen's civil right to self-defense. Since then, many other states have followed suit, overturning laws requiring a duty to retreat.

Also, California's stand-your-ground right applies in public and has nothing to do with castle doctrine. When in your home, Californians have the statutory rights to shoot any non-resident who forcibly enters the home or attempts to enter.

Also, you are wrong about Oregon.  In 2007, in *Oregon v. Sandoval*, Oregon's courts followed California and ruled that the duty to retreat was unconstitutional. Juries in Oregon cannot be instructed that someone had a duty to retreat in a self-defense case.

In fact, most states have followed California in either overturning duty to retreat language in the courts or in passing civil rights legislation confirming the human right to stand your ground and not retreat.

6661,"hxz2fag",1,0,"/r/politics","That person isn’t trans. And I’m more worried about politicians in restrooms. Let’s do the math: 

https://www.transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/USTS-Full-Report-FINAL.PDF

•	⁠Trans Women (MTF) make up only 32% of the total transgender population. The rest are Trans Men, Non-binary, etc. (p.44)
•	⁠Out of the Surveyed Trans Women, only 68% have already transitioned. The rest are either still questioning or planning on transitioning some day. (p.47)
•	⁠53% of trans women ""sometimes or always"" avoid public restrooms (p.228)

Let's assume that the trans women who have already transitioned but never avoid public restrooms are using women's restrooms on a regular basis.

1.4 million * 32% * 68% * 47% = ~143,181 trans women using the women's restrooms on a regular basis.

143,181 trans women / 4100 Senators = 34.9 times as many trans women regularly using the women's restrooms as there have ever been Senators

Let's also remember that ""Trans woman committing sexual assault in a restroom"" is also an incredibly rare crime. Let's highball the number and say that a dozen instances of this crime have occurred (I'd be surprised if it was even half that, though).

Also, to make things easier, I'm going to count all 12,415 people who have ever served in Congress including the House and the Senate, plus the 18 presidents who have never served in Congress. So 12,433 in total

Source: https://history.house.gov/Institution/Total-Members/Total-Members/#:~:text=Since%20the%20U.S.%20Congress%20convened,with%20service%20in%20both%20chambers.

Let's look at the Wikipedia list of Federal Political Sex Scandals. While not all political sex scandals were cases of sexual assault perse, let's assume that the amount of politicans who are serial offenders (Donald Trump for example) and the amount of unrecorded cases of federal politicians committing sexual assault makes up that.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_federal_political_sex_scandals_in_the_United_States

92 according to this page. I know it's not a perfect number, but the true number would be impossible to obtain so this is the closest I think we can get.

12 highball estimate for bathroom sexual assault / 143,181 trans women =

A trans woman using the women's restroom on a regular basis has, at maximum, a 0.008381% chance of ever committing sexual assault in a women's restroom

92 federal political sex scandals / 12,433 federal politicians =

A Senator, House Member, or President has a 0.74% chance of having a federal political sex scandal, and we're assuming that the total amount of sex assault in this demographic is more or less the same as that number.

(Thinking about it, this might even be a low-ball estimate)

**Meaning Members of Congress and Presidents are approx. 88 times more dangerous than trans women in restrooms.**"

1. russia was promised that there wouldnt be any nato at their border.

2.  after the US backed pro US oligarchs against russian backed oligarchs ,and won , russia obviously wouldnt take that in their historic backyard. a country full of russians and a gigantic russian marine base in the Krim peninsula.

3. american imperialism , 7 wars of the last 20 years that lead to genocides, regional instability and the erosion of the international community standards has led to russias emboldened own interventions in syria , north africa and central asia. 

4. americas hardcore hypocricy concerning all these former points ,its lies and the way it frames itself and russia, pushed russia towards this and worse, towards the chinese. this is a clusterfuck created by the state department , neocons and military industrial neoliberals pushing their lobby agendas in congress and media. 

and Western people eat it up. 20 years of lies,  half truths and massive disinformation campaigns, and the liberal public ,like the conservatives, falls for it, every fucking time.

Said he would leave Afghanistan... instead just months before he would leave office helped release all the Taliban soldiers and said ""next presidents problem.""  


Would Russia invade Ukraine if Trump was president... Who knows... but I doubt he would've done anything to stop them. Hell they probably started this years ago thinking Trump would still be president. Trump didn't stop or say anything about Russia invading Ukraine's eastern boarders to support separatists during his entire presidency."
7236,"hy4ccrn",1,0,"/r/politics","Donald Trump has been a Russian asset for years, even prior to being elected as POTUS, he laundered Russian money. Obama slapped heavy-ass sanctions on Russia that deeply affected Putin's circle of oligarchs (thus partly why Trump despises Obama specifically).

Trump brought on Manafort to launder more money for Russia through the NRA / DB and feed the Trump and GOP pocket book after his campaign went belly up. Putin paid Manafort, Putin paid Giuliani's Ukraine trip to get dirt on Bidens. Rudy got the ambassador to Ukraine fired.

Trump was afraid of the Mueller investigation because.. obviously.. so he brought in Barr. Meanwhile he sued up to the SCOTUS to block access to DB records. Barr also protected Rudy.

That's before we even get into the tie between DB and SCOTUS justice Kennedy, or Trump's push to allow Crimea to be Putin's so he could build his hotel in Yalta, or even Trump's push to weaken sanctions on Russia - that Republicans had to codify in order to prevent.

If you don't believe at this point that Trump is an asset owned by Russia, you need to re-evaluate all the things you think couldn't be possible.

We had a law firm client who was active fighting payday loan operations and i got a full briefing one afternoon on their practices, they are a hideously parasitic legal extortion and how they can be legal to own and run is beyond me. 

You have to keep in mind no one needs to use one of these places unless you need to and those are vulnerable people. They do use them and many cases without issues. But when you’re vulnerable that also means to all obligations including one of these payday operators who do exactly what a loan shark does in respect to internet rate penalties and more. Should something happen that you didn’t make your payment, you’ve set the trap. Once you’ve set the trap, there’s only one way and it’s a financial penalty spiral that sees these people paying far far far more than the principle amount. Way more. 

The fact that these disgusting business can continue and donate to Americas political system is frightening. These parasites need a population of poor people.

7512,"hxzi5a3",1,0,"/r/politics","Yeah i wonder that as well. Free college as long as you sign up for a loan? Smells off to me. Do we really have a well thought out plan here? If we’re just paying for everyone’s college, yeah then college attendance is more about merit, that’s probably good. But then the counterargument is going to be that the government is wasting money teaching kids things like underwater basket weaving or whatever. I’d rather avoid a knee-jerk “defund the police” slogan that not only isn’t well thought out, but isn’t really what we want, anyway. And i don’t want to cherry pick majors (like STEM) for free college, in effect locking poorer people out of following their artistic bliss.

I’d rather everyone get really well paid to the point that they can afford to pay back their loans, and if they can’t, then the school they went to should be on the hook for some of it. The interest needs to be capped as well. Still probably a tough situation for some, though we need to make it manageable; end of the day, those people signed up for the loans.

No one is ever denied for a federal student loan, assuming they got into some accredited school, regardless of their credit worthiness or income, because the government and college aren't taking on any risk. 

A bank has to get money from somewhere and could absolutely lose that money if you don't pay it back. That's *why* they won't give an 18 y/o $50k to buy a car or $200k for a mortgage. The government has none of that risk and is even willing to forgive most of what you owe/more than you initially borrowed, because they can print new money and don't bear a loss if you don't pay back the loans."

He makes an interesting argument that I find pretty compelling and seems to explain at least some of the resentment politics we see growing now, especially among the right.  

We are placed in a society where those who are not educated are often not seen as valued.   We place high value on those that get highly educated but the flip side of this is low value gets placed on those that are not.  Those that do well are seen as fully deserving of that success with the implication being that those that do not do well are also fully deserving of that non-success.

Then comes along a leader who panders to those non-elites by suggesting it is the fault of others for their lack of success.  Usually the arguments are ones we all have heard -  It is the fault of immigrants, it is the fault of liberal elites, etc...

The ideal solution would be to shift the notion of value in society and increase the baseline dignity across all groups in society. Granted this is likely very hard because those that are well educated and successful are generally not willing to accept a shift in values either as it would come with a concession that they are where they are mostly due to luck - otherwise there would be no argument for a shift (if you feel you ""deserve"" your success and it is not due to mostly luck, you will not want to shift these notions).

So instead, a populist like Trump comes along and panders to that resentment.  We can say that Trump sounds like an uneducated idiot, so the uneducated will follow him but it goes deeper than that.  I think it is also the case he also gives them a sense of value and dignity that they aren't getting from the rest of society that makes them feel unvalued."

What drives the average voter to the poll are issues democrats are currently struggling with -- inflation, COVID policies at schools, in-person schooling, a rise in violent crime and theft and healthcare. I think Dems are the party best equipped to handle most of these, but Dems have done themselves no favors being soft of crime and making it harder to return to school."

That's the point. They'd be able to actually invest in something that builds them long-term and familial wealth. They'd actually be able to start families without worry of not being able to provide.

My point is that it's a two-pronged problem that requires 2 things to solve it. The cancellation of student debt, even if it's just a portion of it, and an expansion of public funding to include at least an associate's degree to make it free at the point of service. That way, once at least an associate's is obtained,  newly graduated individuals can actually start their lives. They can buy a house, they can start a family. Of course that's gonna be debt on them, but it's for an investment they can actually pass on to the next generation. You can't pass your years of education to your next of kin. But you can pass a house to them. And in this country, what you own is everything. A house is always viewed as a sound investment because it's viewed as a sign of upward mobility.

Also to this point 

> You say that $300/mo isn't ""that much"", but it can be all the difference.

Trust me, I understand it can make a difference. I've lived very frugally because I have to. So any amount extra is helpful. But I shouldn't have to live that frugally. No one should have to live like that. That extra $$ should just be a given since the gap between a HS diploma and an associates degree isn't that large despite the cost associated with the associate's degree. 

The point I was trying to make was that that $300 isn't enough to make a **substantial** difference in a person's life. I've lived that difference, I know firsthand. That extra $300 isn't going to lift the burdens anyone has. Sure I might feel a bit of relief, but it isn't going to make any substantial difference.

Hence he didn't vote to convict Trump in the 2nd Impeachment but said that he knew he was responsible for it all and that justice would catch up to him. This is how he does it without having to have his caucus vote against him and alienate their base by being seen to oppose Dear Leader."

Reality is not simple. It is not black and white.

Telling the truth is difficult, not only because of the complexities, but because there are simply things we do not know.

A common layperson wants to listen to and follow someone who appears resolute and knows exactly what is right/good and what is wrong/bad. The truth is far messier. People don't want to listen to someone that hedges against the unknown or outlines the details that depend on specific circumstances and scenarios.

I'm absolute terms, a third rate modern power could demolish each those nations at their height. Especially the Romans and Mongolians, who would have no answer for airpower.

Also, in absolute terms, no pre-modern state had the ability to project power globally, for obvious reasons.

In relative terms, each of those nations had peer competitiors that posed a significant threat to them and their interests. For the Romans, the Parthians/Sassanids and the Ethiopian Empire were close by peer competitiors that could (and did!) twart Roman interests. A bit further afield lay the Han Empire and a variety of powers in India, which Rome had neither the logistical capability nor the military power to bring to heel.

For the Mongols, there were the Mamluks, the Vietnamese, the Japanese, and arguably the Hungarians, each of which kept their lands from being added to the Mongolian Empire.

Finally, the British Empire. I'm going to look at the second British Empire at its height, rather than the first British Empire (which was not even the most powerful empire of its day). The second British Empire had at least five rivals: France, Germany, the United States, and Russia, and later Japan, each of which could (and did!) resist the will of the British Empire.

This isn't to say that the above powers weren't incredible and unique, they all were, in different ways. But at no point were they the sole undisputed hyperpower. For a brief bit between the fall of the USSR and 9/11, the United States was.

8865,"hy4ej66",1,0,"/r/politics","In January, the FDA issued a statement about Ambien (the brand name for the drug zolpidem), one of the most popular insomnia medications in the U.S. The agency recommended using lower bedtime doses than we'd previously been prescribing, out of concern that current doses could leave people impaired the next morning. They recommend the cut even for patients who haven't ended up feeling groggy, and especially in women (who don't metabolize the medication as quickly as men). The recommendations also included a warning to insomnia medications in general:

To decrease the potential risk of impairment with all insomnia drugs, health care professionals should prescribe, and patients should take, the lowest dose capable of treating the patient's insomnia.
As doctors debated the merits of these claims, Ambien made the news again last month when a national study reported that the number of emergency department (E.D.) visits related to adverse reactions from Ambien has risen by almost 220% in 5 years:

The number of zolpidem-related E.D. visits involving adverse reactions increased nearly 220 percent from 2005 to 2010.
Females accounted for two thirds of zolpidem-related E.D. visits involving adverse reactions in 2010. Patients over 65 represented one third.
Half of visits involved patients who had combined other medications with zolpidem, including narcotics, anti-anxiety medications, and other insomnia meds.

9119,"hy3tcz8",1,0,"/r/politics","Global oil economics are horrifically complex.  Anyone who simply points to something like ""We used to export more than we imported, so we were energy independent"" doesn't have the first clue what they are talking about.  The notion that being a net exporter makes you ""energy independent"" belies just how little one understands the global oil market.

First, not all oil is the same. There are four different types of crude (actually about 160 when you get into sub-groups), and those types are used to make different types and qualities of distillates.  For example, light oil can be used for transportation fuels (e.g. petrol) but not much else; heavy crude can be used for many transportation fuels, but also plastics and composites.  

Second, not only do these fuels have different uses, but also they have different prices.  So if you reroute one type of oil for a different type of production, that can have tremendous spillover effects for consumers.  Hard to be ""energy independent"" if, for example, it means the cost of gasoline goes to $6/gallon or you can't pave streets because asphalt isn't available.

Third, there are different types of refineries with different processes to conform to the market needs and regulations of the target market.  They also have to be configured in such a way as to process the type of crude they are receiving. Refineries aren't a simple plug-and-play for different types of oil and different markets.  

Fourth, transportation and logistics is tremendously complicated. We export oil from specific sites to specific destinations because of the cost of transport. This was the entire purpose of the Keystone Pipeline -- it was designed to move crude from Canada down to the Gulf Coast refineries (with some stops along the way) -- but those refineries were then going to export the products to Europe and Latin America.  

The reality is that oil markets are far more complicated than just asking if X - I > 0.  Just because you are a net exporter doesn't mean that you have achieved energy independence."

9600,"hy3stth",1,0,"/r/politics","I’d like to offer some ‘good case scenario’ analysis, centering around the motives of the players.

So first of all, a large scale invasion won’t happen. If it does, the sanctions on Russia will be crippling. The trade with Europe will be affected and many American companies have vital interest in them and in the broad European economy. I doubt if anyone wants that to happen at all.

Second of all, let’s examine the motive of Putin. What does he want? He knows Ukraine is drifting away and at this point it’s pretty much irreversible. But to safeguard the border, he would have to have some ‘buffer zone’. Therefore he orchestrated the ‘independence’ of these two regions, placing the military around Ukraine as a threat to make sure Ukraine does not respond fiercely. Now that he got the buffer zone he wanted, it’s doubtful that he is willing to escalate this. Since Ukraine is not In NATO, the NATO will basically just be training and supplying some weapons. It’s very unlikely that they will venture an incursion into the Donbas region.

Now finally, what does the US want? Why the US is acting like a maniac, almost unilaterally declaring that Russia is going to invade Ukraine like ghengis khan leading his steeds and cover the country with blood? Why it’s denying any possibility of accepting some of Putin’s demands as if wanting there to be major conflict? First of all, US wants an unstable and weak Russia. Making the situation bigger will allow the US to come up with more severe sanctions. It can also shake up the ties between European countries and Russia, ensuring that the US’s dominance will persist (if we ignore China for a second). There is absolutely no way that the US is going to put boots on the ground. But the weapon companies are very happy to sell more weapons, either to the pentagon to donate them or to Eastern European countries who feel threatened by the move. So weaker opponent and profit on the fears, why not?

My guess is that this is Putin’s multi-year (or even decade) plan to encroach the eastern Ukraine, possibly up to Kyiv. This step will be just like the 2014 Crimea crisis, put a little dent in the market and then it’s effects will fizzle out."

He talked about structural economic issues in addition to just front line stuff like raising the minimum wage eg infrastructure, jobs, Which are also not necessarily in progressives’ wheelhouse.

If people want to push the Democrats to the left, these things need to happen:

1) Democratic politicians need to feel secure that passing laws for left-leaning priorities will get them reelected, not voted out.

2) They need to feel like running left will not cost them in a general election.

3) They need to feel that the real threat to staying in office is that they will lose a primary challenge from the left.

This is exactly the mechanism by which the Republican party moved to the right, because Republicans in congress aren't afraid of general elections, they're afraid of a primary challenge from the right.

But if he had been elected, you're right that he would have been more like Bush Jr, because he would have had a basic understanding of what was allowed to say and do.  People want to credit Trump for being bold for the things he does, but it's really because he's stupid.

10512,"hy36ka9",1,0,"/r/politics","You’re incorrect, here.  If you’re discussing the *circumstances* surrounding when a person is allowed to use deadly force to protect herself, the only thing which really changes is the most trivial.  In practice, the line between “I was in fear for my life” and “I was in fear for my life and did not think I could get away” is very, *very* thin in a courtroom.

Don’t believe me?  Look at the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse: the judge ruled that none of the ~~crimes Rittenhouse committed~~ “circumstances” leading up to the shootings mattered, only whether Rittenhouse was reasonably in fear of his life at the moment he pulled the trigger.  Wisconsin does not have SYG.  Wisconsin’s deadly force law includes the threat of grievous bodily harm (meaning his brandishing a rifle could be considered deadly force in and of itself).  Wisconsin’s deadly force laws specifically prohibit the use of deadly force to defend property which does not belong to to the defender.  Wisconsin’s deadly force law specifically invalidates the use of deadly force if the need for it is prompted by the commission of a crime.  *None of that mattered*.

Side note: if it seems like the judge simply disregarded the laws of his own state to stack the deck in favor of the defendant, I wholeheartedly agree with you.  I’m still salty over that case—but…point remains.

So if you’re arguing that SYG changes the *circumstances* by which deadly force is justified, you’re making bad assumptions, and you need to revisit your thinking."

10565,"hy0io8n",1,0,"/r/politics","I am for more free education.  I'm not arguing against it.  

What I'm arguing against is forgiving loans without changing the system to, at a minimum, prevent similar debt in the future.  More free education would be a bonus that I would support.

Even by your own math, the numbers don't dispute what I'm saying.  You say that $300/mo isn't ""that much"", but it can be all the difference.  It can be the difference between having a car and not.  It can be the difference between having various utilities, and not.  It can be the difference between being able to afford a much needed vacation, and not.  It is even the difference between being able to save for retirement, thus being able to retire, and not.  That's huge, and that's pretty much the smallest difference.  Compare that to a 4 year degree and now you're $500 more per month.  

If someone offered me 130k over 40 years, but I'd have to pay 40k back over the same time period, it would be a no brainer.  This isn't mass hysteria.  If the math didn't work out and it didn't pay off for the vast majority of people, they wouldn't do it.

This all ignores the likelihood that the vast majority of these people asking for student debt forgiveness, wouldn't just be debt free anymore.  They'd be taking that money and putting it towards some other investment.  Instead of struggling because their student loans are suffocating them, now it's their mortgage...or whatever else they'd put it towards."

It was about once a week that those girls were being called N words- asked about their dad (who is not in the picture- so guess where that goes) and teased about fried chicken and watermelon. 

Fortunately that option was there for her and her girls- more rural places in the state don’t have broadband access. 

But even the less northern places have plenty of Trump 2024 flags flying. It’s exhausting."

He won because all the other republicans ""just had to outlast trump"" and then they'd be in for sure.  

The problem is that after they didn't outlast him, they all fell in line behind him."

Worst news: I've approved unilateral air and artillery support for Ukraine.

Edit: Actually Best News, Russia is withdrawing and UN has agreed that the UN will own peacekeepign efforts. Aka no Russians in the area, BUT lots of NATO troops in the area."

Hillary Clinton also went under oath addressing the same concerns with the special prosecutors office and the FBI. Nothing came of it. Decades worth of investigations. 

Investigations into Trump have led to 34 individuals being convicted of felonies. Trump himself has refused to go under oath or cooperate with these investigations."

Also, stating someone has committed a crime when you're reasonably sure they haven't is defamation per se. That standard might be relaxed if someone with law enforcement capacity makes the statement, but as the governor probably has numerous IT department/consultants and digital criminal forensics experts on the state's payroll, it would be hard to assert they were reasonably sure a crime was committed. Unless they want to plead negligence, which would be just as bad."

So you ignore them, and focus that energy to get more people on your side to vote.

I'm a single issue voter. That means the great majority of time I end up voting Republican. Calling me racist and transphobic is not going to cause me to change my vote.

So you will just have to out vote me."
