My oldest for instance did very poorly with school closures, and thrives in school.  Same house, but different kid, my daughter, would love nothing more than staying home and using her Chromebook.  

But I do think what you are proposing is just another form of school choice.  I will say that technology is changing the way kids are educated, some good, some bad.  

I'm all for school choice, and in fact did choose my residence based on the school system.  I'm also a top 5% income and have that choice. 

The dirty secret about inner city schools (and meth infected rural states) that no one wants to talk about?  Broken families.  My kids could go to a liberal cesspool and they'll still be fine.  We teach lots of family values at home, and *live those values all the time.*  Single parent homes, multi-generation 'itakesavillage' homes with mom and dad in and out of the picture, etc have clearly shown to be detriments to success.

The whole narrative that they won't do what they did to Trump is false and just putting blinders on.  They've proven over and over there's no bottom to the depths they won't go to destroy whomever it is.  Some of you younger guys may not remember, but Bush was treated the same way for both of his terms being called Nazi, racist, etc.  Nothing has really changed only that now with social media, it's only gotten louder.

356,"hxzethn",5,1,"/r/Conservative","The US doesn't have that right. But it tries to do so anyway because it's a huge strategic interest. If Germany becomes truly dependent on Russia for gas, they will have no choice but to start favoring Russian policies and stances in all political theatres. NATO, the UN etc. If there is ever a policy or proposal which would seriously hurt Russia, they can threaten to cut the gas. Maybe in the long term Germany will be fine, but in the short term those cuts will hurt and German politicians may have no choice politically but to give in. Adding another pipeline allows Germany to become more dependent on Russian gas, so the US wants to prevent that.

From the US perspective, even if they don't technically have a moral right to interfere, they do have an very obvious interest in interfering anyway. Although, it would be a whole lot more effective if the US provided an alternative solution to Russian gas, maybe selling its own gas to Germany at lower costs. Whatever happens, Germany needs energy, blocking the pipeline but not offering an alternative will only delay the inevitable. But if their trying to buy time to get a deal in place to solve Germany's energy issues while keeping them independent of Russian gas, then blocking it right now makes sense. Morals can only go so far, sometimes practical necessity and geopolitics takes over the decision making process."

It is political death, and that would not have any effect on the outcome anywayof the outcome anyway.

When Canadians vote, they vote for the party, not necessarily for the MP. The MP is on the ballot, but it is not like the US where you can vote for a Democrat senator, an independent congressman, and the Republican president separately if you wanted to. You simply vote for the MP representing the party you want to win. And it is first past the post for each riding. It is totalitarian in its setup with no checks. In fact, Canadian senators are appointed by the ruling party and are basically a rubber stamp to laws. Most senators have offices and don't even show up for ""work."" Harper tried to reform it but was thwarted a lot. Some people want to remove the senators altogether.

Trump is a prima dona and at this point doing more harm than good in the political arena IMHO. We need leadership and he‚Äôs seemingly more interested in settling personal scores and massaging his bruised ego than doing right by the country. We need to move on from him.

As I said if I can‚Äôt be a Republican to you and Trump loyalists without kissing his ring then sorry I‚Äôm just not interested in that level of demagoguery and egotism. How can a constituent have faith in their representatives if they can‚Äôt think or act for themselves without calling in to check on what Donald Trump thinks  about it first?

I‚Äôm America first not Donald Trump first. I‚Äôm more interested in policy than personality and so are most voters. We stick with Trump as the face of our party instead of just adopting his policies and moving forward with fresh blood and we lose elections and America loses.

This isn‚Äôt the popular thing to say here but they‚Äôre the facts. Donald Trump is not popular and if the GOP puts all their eggs in Trump‚Äôs basket, and again I‚Äôm talking about him as a person and candidate not the policies, that‚Äôs a recipe for disaster.

>BERLIN ‚Äî Germany has taken steps to halt the process of certifying the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia, Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Tuesday, as the West started taking punitive measures against Moscow over the Ukraine crisis.

>Scholz told reporters in Berlin that his government was taking the measure in response to Moscow‚Äôs actions in Ukraine.

>The pipeline bringing natural gas from Russia to Germany has long been criticized by the United States and some European countries who argue that it increases Europe‚Äôs reliance on Russian energy supplies.

>Scholz said that the government had decided to ‚Äúreassess‚Äù the certification of the pipeline, which hasn‚Äôt begun operating yet, in light of the latest developments.

>‚ÄúThat will certaintly take time, if I may say so,‚Äù he said.

If you both agree that neither socialism or capitalism have not been properly implemented, then (historically speaking) trying to figure out how a socialist system would work would be more likely to end up badly than a capitalistic society. You can say Stalin's Russia wasn't true communism, but the fact is that what has historically happened is that the Trotskys and the Lennins get ousted and the Stalins take over, because the Stalins are the ones who will do anything to get power in any political structure, be it socialist or capitalist. You have to fix that if you want socialism to work

I'm a democratic socialist but still can admit that every attempt at true socialism or communism has resulted in worse outcomes for the average citizen than even the United States' current capitalistic structure. The American standard of living is still head and shoulders above 90-95% of other countries and trying to say that capitalism has resulted is Americans being worse off than they would have been without capitalism is an unwinnable argument. If you actually want to bring people over to our side you have to admit that our plan for how a socialist government would work is extremely flawed in the real world because of the amount of bad actors who want power, and we have to completely rethink how it should be implemented. It's not useful to come in here and just scream ""socialism is better reeeeeeeee,"" you're actually making it harder for the rest of us by being such a belligerent asshat

Socialism doesn't automatically get rid of bad people taking advantage of the system, it just changes the landscape and concentrates power. When you concentrate power that much and those people finally crack the code, it becomes insanely easy for a Stalin or a Pinochet or a Kim to quickly manipulate their way into being a Supreme leader. If you want to convince someone, acknowledge that fact and tell them your plan for how you think we should shore up that leak.

Things that have contributed to our decline.   
1. The inability to actually purchase commercial property. We get out bid by equity groups, then have to deal with leasing from them. They get greedy on the lease and there is not much we can do about it. So we just have to fork over the cash. It's literally a you either lease from them or you don't own a business. Commercial property never comes up for sale and when it does it's dozens of equity groups outbidding actual business owners who want to actually use it. One of the locations we have, we have been there 20 years. Building probably cost the Land Lord maybe $500-700k to build. We've shelled out well over $1.4 Million over 20 years on the lease and cam. Lease and cam today are running north of $50k a year. It's ridiculous, the worst part? The landlord inherited it from her father about 8 years ago. She's been special to say the least. We would have loved to have purchased it, but never get/have the opportunity. I tried to buy a location up the street and bid more 15% above market. Some equity group outbid us. Then they tried to lease us the building.. It's such a racket/scam.   
2. Health insurance premiums, they are insane.. $58k a year to insure 7 people.   
3. Disappearing middle class, the small business owners were my bread and butter. They'd make any place from $250-300k a year maybe more. They'd have no issue dropping $6500-12k a year with us. I've watched them all get taken out by Amazon, Google, Walmart and the like.   
4. Big businesses getting into our industry. They have all the advantages on earth. They can self insure, they have their own legal teams, they can get products cheaper.. They cut the middle man out.. it all leads to them being able to offer a price point I simply can not match.  
5. Litigation is another big one. It's a constant threat and I constantly spend a fortune trying to avoid it.

Not that it matters, but I'm vaxxed (was forced due to employment), but I could give two shits about what anyone else does.  I don't walk around worrying about what everyone else is doing.

As you described it, i feel their mentality is irrational forced compliance.  How the hell did we get here.  They leave no openness to natural immunity for one.  Taking that stance also makes no sense in the context of obese people and hard-core smokers and drinkers which are a 'tax' on the healthcare system as well. Are they proposing they shouldn't qualify for medical care? 

And guess what- say anything like this to them and immediately they pull what they think is moral superiority (which is misplaced) and say you hate science, you don't care about anyone around you, and you're every '-ist' in their word salad playbook.  Having a conversation is impossible with them.  And say anything remote like this on an average sub, and in about 3 minutes you'll be banned.  I know this from experience.

I'm not  sure the left even knows what 'progressive' even means.  I personally hate the word.  All progressive means is change.  Not always, in fact quite frequently, change isn't good.  So I always wonder what's utopia for them.  They want change- ok for what, and how much change is 'needed', and who determines that the change is good or complete or successful?

Clearly not asking you to answer, this is all rhetorical. 

When Andrew Scheer ran for the conservatives, then later with Erin O'Tool, each said that the abortion (as an example) debate won't be opened.  But the media never let the questioning die and threw Trudeau softballs constantly.  Trudeau even sued to keep certain journalists and media outlets away from being able to ask him questions.

The Liberals across both past elections lost the popular vote; conservatives won both times.

He absolutely would be a ""limited purpose public figure"" in any suit. The shooting was legitimately a newsworthy event which was widely reported before anyone even knew who he was. The press (and everyone else) therefore gets to talk about it as a public event and the people involved as public figures (for the purposes of talking about the public event) under a much higher standard for defamation. He'll have to prove ""actual malice"" or ""reckless disregard"" which is *extremely* hard to do. He basically needs rock solid proof that someone *knowingly* lied to do him harm... Unless there's an email from Cenk or Whoopi saying something like ""I don't care if it's not true, I'm going to crucify this kid anyway"" it's going to be almost impossible to prevail in court.

Nick Sandmann had a *much* easier time. He didn't do anything newsworthy and the thing that MADE it newsworthy was a few journalists tweeting about it and a couple of initial news reports mostly based on those same tweets. Those initial journalists and news outlets at the very least were going to have to deal with the much lower bar of *negligence* in their reporting about a private individual. Subsequent news agencies could probably have gotten away with the higher bar once the first outlest made it a story but that just adds to the damage done to him by those first irresponsible journalists who negligently said things about a private individual without bothering with ANY due diligence to actually establish the actual facts."

Additionally, Trump instituted the sanctions against Nord Stream 2 on January 19th, 2021 which was his second last day in office. This directly disproves your theory that he was attempting to cozy up to Putin and Moscow as he took a hardline approach in the lame duck session. 

The company that picked up construction after Swiss Allseas suspended construction following the sanctions was German Nord Stream Ag which is a subsidiary of Gazprom (which the Russian Government holds majority control over).

Look I did not support the breadth of wars in the middle east, but a military response to 9/11 was obviously justified.

It is not in this case. We shouldn't do anything about Russia. 

Our justification for our own annexation of Hawaii and Texas was that the American settlers there, who initially were expats living in foreign countries, eventually became a majority and wanted to join the united states. America supports self determination. This justification let us annex these regions, and rightfully so. Land doesn't belong to an ethnic group but rather to the actual people who actually live on a piece of land...

The eastern parts of Ukraine are mostly Russians who want Putin. Despite unsubstantiated claims the referenda in Crimea we're rigged, one cannot deny the outright celebrations upon their takeover by Russia. We have ample video evidence the crimeans wanted that.

Our own experiences with Afghanistan should teach us that if a population actually didn't want occupation, they will use guerilla tactics to keep out a foreign aggressor for an interminable amount of time. Where are the freedom fighters in Crimea? Hint... There are none. They want to be part of Russia. That is their right.

The true reason world leaders are afraid of this is they are afraid this will embolden separatist groups in their own countries to declare independence and reassert the fundamental human right to self determination, which always supercedes the made up right of particular nation states to exist.

1. The European Union imports 27% of its crude oil, 41% of its natural gas, and 47% of its coal from Russia. With regards to natural gas, Germany's reliance on Russia is over 50%. Europe will not - **cannot** - turn off the spigot of Russian energy on a month's notice; Trump tried to curb Russia's energy influence vis-a-vis Nordstream 2 at least as far back as 2018 (https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/trump-begins-nato-summit-with-nord-stream-2-attack/) and did halt it briefly in 2019 (https://apnews.com/article/c7e7f8430df21f9fe77acba9549c9106) but Biden waived those sanctions in early 2021. Russia has immense leverage over Europe and Nordstream 2 would only increase it. 

2. Trump was expanding American energy production and exporting more energy to Europe (e.g. in 2017, to the Three Seas initiative countries: https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/06/trump-natural-gas-europe-leaders.html); instead Biden has curtailed and blocked production and set us on course to once again be a net importer of energy instead of an exporter - in fact in 2021 we imported more oil from Russia than any previous year: (https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=MTTIM_NUS-NRS_1&f=M).

That predates Trump but it also informed his policy motives with regards to Russia - as far as Trump was concerned, clearly if the world wasn't going to actually treat Russia as a hostile enemy then we might as well treat them respectfully as a sovereign nation and try to find some common ground, and he said as much (which the subservient media spun into a years long Trump loves Putin narrative). Instead of that happening, the Democrat party and neocon Republicans spent 4-5 years demonizing Russia over a fake collusion hoax and fomenting as much hatred by half the domestic population against Russia as there had ever been during the Cold War. That sabotaged any chances Trump might have had to shift US-Russian relations toward a more positive path.

Trump had the right foreign policy direction early in his term and had we carried it out with diligence, Russia would have been poorer and had less leverage over Europe than they do now. You can thank Democrats, neocons, European socialists and the domestic media for working their hardest to denigrate and thwart every move he made to avoid a situation like we see now. Had the bureaucratic deep state in our government supported the President instead of trying to backstab him and the seeds Trump planted in 2017 and 2018 been able to grow forward to 2022, Trump wouldn't have had to deal with the current situation, period."

The underlying data manipulation is a far greater concern. It has caused not just one country to react, but almost all of them.

The rest of the country freaked that so many were dying and it was based on incredibly stupid missteps (and I am being nice here). It's a fucking mess of failures that none of them want to admit.

As far as the for some reason you added in there. It is because of the ""invader"" sometimes the immune system goes overboard it's actually why covid is as bad as it is. The protein isn't special in the regard. For instance in the the protein in mrna vaccines has a lipid shell

This is going to be a copy pasta from me previously explaining this. This is what is in the moderna vaccine.

I can give the full scientific breakdowns for each (I will link it though it's a beefy piece of work.)

---

Nucleoside-modified mRNA encoding the viral spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2

That's the active ingredient and is broken down within two days as messenger RNA usually is (because the body produces it, and free floating Mrna ends being quickly broken down by enzymes)

2[(polyethylene glycol (PEG))-2000]-N,N-ditetradecylacetamide

1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine

Cholesterol

These four are the lipid shell that is needed so the bodies enzymes don't IMMEDIATELY break the MRNA down. They are very common and well tolerated. There are some sensitivities polyethylene glycol (it's in a lot of things food wise, and certain formulations are literally miralax) Folks fill out a sheet to for the folks giving it to find if that's a concern.
Basically think of the lipid layer as a capsule pill. The drug is on the inside and the capsule is so the body doesn't absorb the drug too quickly or not get any benefit out of it.

Sodium chloride (salt)
Monobasic potassium phosphate
Potassium chloride
Dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate

Those are salts. They are very basic things that are being used so the acidity level matches your bodies acidity level. All of which are common, and well tolerated.

And finally sucrose. Yes they put a little sugar(precursor to sugar) to help prevent those components from getting damaged from the freezing.
---

There is a reason hit pieces focus on the ""spike protein"". Despite the fact the body treats it like spare parts if not for the lipid shell. It isn't special. You experience systemic or localized reactions to any invader. In this case the sore arm is a localized reaction and chills are systemic(body wide) reactions. Examples Tylenol produces a more systemic response where as topically applied lidocaine produces a localized response.

Please note this is a very high level overview and isn't comprehensive. If you want comprehensive then I can provide that in whatever skill level you feel you are.

Contrary to opinions there are, were and will be dozens of scientists pulling the slow down string at any given point. The difference is they are not talking to you because if you hear slow down you will think it means there is something inherently wrong probably permanently. Where as if they tell another scientist to slow down it means this area needs to be looked at post haste. It doesn't mean there is something bad but it does not mean there isn't. It's like concluding a dirty dish on a counter means rats live around it if that makes sense.

1.  make america great again goes to traditionalism and this misguided belief in the ""good ole' days"" and that we should return to an era of rampant sexism, racism, and just a generally shittyness for anyone who wasn't white.

3. Any acknowledgement of Trump over his Presidency will tell you that he didn't really plan things out and that the Republican party was just ""whatever trump wants"" without any foresight.
4. ""Fake News"" is the beginning of ""disagreement is treason"".  Anything that doesn't agree with his narrative is fake and he lashed out at reporters for bringing attention to anything he disagreed with.
5. Fear of difference goes hand-in-hand with anti-immigration and Muslim rhetoric that was spewed his entire administration.
6. This one every politician does, its just what politicians due, can't really fault him for that.
7. ""Deep State"" is a plot based obsession.
8. Democrats were both incompetent his entire administration and also somehow capable of preventing anything he tried accomplishing.  Everything good was because of him and everything bad was the fault of everyone else.
9. Eh, I don't really have a good one for this.  I might come back to this later if i think of something that applies here.
10. Paying the slight iota of attention to him in 4 years makes this one self-explanatory.
11. Same as 10
12. lol, same as 10

Section Three of the Fourteenth Amendment disqualifies an individual from serving as a state or federal official if that person has ""*engaged in insurrection or rebellion against*"" the United States. This includes the funding, instigating, promoting, or facilitating in an insurrection. It was a clause written within the context of the Civil War but was also included to theoretically apply for members of future rebellions or insurrections against the United States.
  

  
A person who through **prompting** causes a lawless act is guilty of that act.
  

  
""Imminent lawless action"" is a standard currently used that was established by the **United States Supreme Court** in Brandenburg v. Ohio (**1969**) It defined the limits of freedom of speech. Brandenburg clarified what constituted a ""clear and present danger"", the standard established by Schenck v. United States (1919). 
  

  
This Supreme Court Ruling firmly established that speech that merely advocated violence could be illegal. Under the imminent lawless action test, speech is not protected by the First Amendment if the speaker intends to incite a violation of the law that is both imminent and likely.
  

  
**Cawthorn** who spoke at the pre-attack rally, is quoted as saying if elections ‚Äúare stolen,‚Äù it will ‚Äúlead to one place, and that‚Äôs bloodshed,‚Äù and added that he is ‚Äúwilling to defend liberty at all costs‚Äù.

I am seeing lots of propaganda getting thrown around on all sides, and it is difficult to tease out the real facts, but we have to try. Putin is a genius, and calling sections of Ukraine independent, and then going in to liberate them from their ""oppressors"" is a brilliant propaganda move. Acknowledging that doesn't change the fact that the result threatens Ukraine's sovereignty. Calling out that strategy as effective propaganda is a better reaction than pretending Putin is stupid. He is clearly not stupid.

That said, Trump is helping spread the Russian side of the propaganda. He is an active and willing Russian intelligence asset, and always has been. Hebhas also managed to turn a great number of Americans into unwitting Russian assets as well. He is a traitor, pure and simple. The fact that Putin was able to place him into the American presidency is further proof of Putin's genius. Certainly our intelligence agencies know that.

Edit: Didn't catch your edit first before replying! Yes rent has been bad but housing supply and prices have been bad before COVID too. Which is why rent is always going up because again it's increased competition for living space that house building isn't able to meet. It's supply vs demand."

Do you have time to volunteer on election day?  Check with your Board of Elections and volunteer to be a poll worker.  Many of these volunteers tend to be on the older and with Covid still rampant, they are more at risk.  There is always a shortage of volunteers.

Does your vote ""not count"" because you in the minority?  If you live in a DEEP red state, your vote is still important but there is still more you can do.  Volunteer for campaigns in more contested races.  Every single campaign needs volunteers and many of them allow you to volunteer remotely.

7261,"hy45e2j",5,0,"/r/politics","The problem is that swing voters don't really exist anymore; clear partisan lines have been drawn, and the number of quasi-mythical fence-sitters who haven't quite decided between fascism and democracy yet are too small in number to be statistically relevant. 

I agree that Biden and the Democrat ""leadership"" (and I'm using the term as loosely as humanly possible here) are focusing their efforts on swing voters, as they always do, and it's just not a functional strategy anymore if it ever was. 

The GOP panders to their base 24/7, and their base turns out for every election no matter how minor as though it's Superbowl Christmas. This occurs even though once in office the GOP enacts policies that directly damage their base. Their voters just don't care.

Meanwhile the Democrats ALSO pander to the GOP base 24/7, accomplishing less than nothing because these people are convinced that we're literally Satan. Simultaneously the Democrats issue condescending lectures to their own base about how silly we are for expecting them to adhere to their party platform or keep campaign promises. Consequently in a turn of events that SHOULD surprise no one but somehow manages to surprise the Democrats every single goddamned time, their base doesn't show up in significant numbers for anything but the biggest elections.

Every election we've lost or won in a nailbiter for the last twenty years should have been a wakeup call for the Democrats to stop chasing imaginary swing voters and focus on getting their own base to show up for elections. Instead they just keep thinking Lucy is going to let them kick the football this time and we're just one more election away from Republican voters deserting the GOP in droves and coming over to our side. It's never going to happen."

Those identities have been empowered and are caught on the power they have to make everyone focus on their issues, history, and perspective.

7886,"hy3wwt0",5,0,"/r/politics","I have no personal stake in this fight since I have no debt of my own, but I'll give you a couple of reasons.

First is one that you hear a lot and that is the fact that while people did sign up for these loans, they did so under significant pressure (17 and 18 year olds who were told their whole life that a college degree was essential to the future) and were told very optimistic things about the job market which awaited them, which projections spectacularly failed to live up to.  In many cases, you have people who are still only able to make the minimum payments as the economy has remained unfavorable for a very long time, and as a result, they have paid a significant amount of money, but most of it continues to go to interest with a large principal (which continues to generate ever more interest).

Secondly, is the benefit in the much broader sense, in the current economy where we as a society need more people spending money and at least doing some investing (whether in retirement funds, stocks, a home, or any other form of property).  Money spent on repaying loans, especially money going towards the interest on a loan, is dead money.  That kind of money does little to stimulate the economy.  Large lenders primarily return their profits to investors, without movement of goods or services really.  Money spent on interest payments is money not able to be spent in stores or for property.

So even if it isn't 'fair', it is in all of our collective best interest to have more people in the economy with more extra money to spend on things that will actually grown the economy."

-I am not American. 

In my opinion, the article is very misleading, edging into false. 
Here‚Äôs why: for a [rogue, dictatorial] president/man (Putin) who is on a seemingly expansionist agenda, this is a way to annex more land without really going into war. The two breakaway regions he recognized as independent, though Ukrainian territory, support Russia. In doing recognizing them as independent, it gave him the leeway he needed to station Russian troops there. And there being no strong enough deterrence to stop him, he gets the land. Blood free (at least for the time being) and at very low cost in every kind of way. 

So yes, it is genius. A very well calculated genius move on Putin‚Äôs part. 

We have called thieves geniuses for breaking into banks, some even killing people. We‚Äôve very likely heard ‚ÄòEvil Genius,‚Äô be it on the Netflix show or elsewhere.

The reason Hunt is weak on issues is because she *can* be weak on these issues, and people will still vote for her. Don't give her the opportunity to be weak on the issues like she already is.

Let's get into the issues now:

*""Decriminalizing Sex Work. Criminalizing sex work drives sex work underground, thus compromising sex workers‚Äô health and safety. Although there have been attempts to criminalize the purchase of sex work, the stigma and fear of legal repercussions persist for the workers themselves, disproportionately affecting trans women of color. Alexandra will work to protect sex workers by decriminalizing prostitution and loitering for adults and expunging past convictions.""*

I agree that we should decriminalize sex work, but we should *also* give sex workers certain rights. They should be able to protect their body, privacy and their money. I've heard of men who ask women to do things that go against their initial agreements, and/or they don't even pay.

""*Medicare for All. Alexandra believes healthcare is a human right. In Congress, Alexandra will vote in favor of a single-payer, high quality, national health insurance program and support the passing of Medicare for All. Alexandra will dismantle the current healthcare industry standard, removing networks, premiums, copays, and deductibles. She will fight to cancel all medical debt and to expand every person‚Äôs access to consistent medical care. Medicare should be expanded to cover mental health; dental, vision, home or community-based, and long-term care; reproductive care; all safe and comprehensive cancer treatments; and prescription drugs.*""

We don't need to nationalize health insurance. We need to nationalize the entire healthcare industry. Also, she forgot to say that she wants to cover *all* prescription drugs.

""*Support Teachers. It is impossible to create a positive learning environment for students when our teachers are not paid a living wage. Alexandra will fight to raise the minimum teacher wage to at least $60,000 and support the rights of our educators to unionize.*""

$60k??? The average pay in Hunt's district is already $60k...

""*Demilitarize the Police. Alexandra understands that gun safety policy and police reform go hand-in-hand.  In Congress, Alexandra will fight to demilitarize all law enforcement, including police officers and security guards, starting immediately with all military-grade weaponry and equipment. She will advocate for the Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act and ending the federal 1033 Program that provides military weaponry to local police departments.*""

ABOLISH\* the police.

""*Housing for All. Alexandra believes that housing is a human right and that stable housing is essential to community prosperity, which is why she supports the Green New Deal for Public Housing Act. The Green New Deal for Public Housing invests in the construction of sustainable public housing options priced at affordable real cost or income-based rates. She advocates for inclusive social housing as an equitable public solution for people of every race, income level, and documentation status. In Philly, this policy would focus on revitalizing old and abandoned housing, retrofitting them with high-efficiency energy systems and appliances. Currently, Black single mothers are most at risk for facing eviction or housing insecurity, making this group a top priority in the demand for housing.* ""

There are 17 million empty houses in the US, and only 500 thousand homeless people. You give housing for all by guaranteeing a house FOR ALL. We can do that right now, and there'd still be 16.5 million empty houses in the US. The problem doesn't need another 10 years to solve. Also, are you funding private energy companies to pay for these energy systems/appliances? Nice way to support funneling more money to the top.

""*Tenants‚Äô Rights. Alexandra will protect tenants by implementing a national rent control standard and a ‚Äújust cause‚Äù requirement for evictions. She will fight to end housing discrimination and ensure housing standards for renters. Alexandra will support the rights of tenants to form tenant unions without retaliation from landlords and will protect survivors of domestic violence from eviction on the basis of their assault. She will support efforts to fully fund the Section 8 rental assistance program and will implement a Section 8 non-discrimination law so landlords cannot discriminate against low-income families or persons.* ""

NO EVICTIONS. PERIOD.

""*Reproductive Rights. Alexandra supports every person‚Äôs religious freedom and right to choose, which is why she is a proponent of reproductive justice and advocates for inclusive reproductive legislation. Alexandra will fight to repeal the Hyde Amendment, oppose efforts to overturn Roe v. Wade, and advocate to expand the WIC program to make reproductive health services affordable and available before, during, and after pregnancy. She will fight to fully fund Planned Parenthood, Title X, and other reproductive justice initiatives that protect and increase the availability of safe and legal abortion and access to contraception. Alexandra understands that equitable reproductive justice supports maternal health and childcare as much as legal and safe abortion and contraception.*""

What about codifying Roe v Wade? What about making reproductive health services FREE (not just affordable)? Why not also include FREE menstrual products??? Women shouldn't have to choose between food on the table and their tampons.

""*The Right to a Dignified Living. Alexandra will support increasing the amount of federal funding for tribal nations with significant investments into communities that lack healthcare, employment opportunities, housing, and quality schools. Enacting the Green New Deal will include the federal jobs guarantee, which will help provide jobs and rebuild the economies of Native communities.*""

Your olive branch to Natives is the Green New Deal? Your solution to the US taking and destroying Native land is to *let* Natives work towards fixing the problems that we caused? Tbh, this is pretty fucked up.

""*Diplomacy. In order to see such a shift in the United States‚Äô foreign policy, adequate resources for strategies of diplomacy, humanitarian aid, development, and healing from war need to be reallocated. Alexandra believes the threats our nation faces can be addressed more effectively with principled diplomacy rather than with bombs, aggressive posturing, or war. Alexandra will support increased funding for the State Department, humanitarian aid, and community-led international development programs. She will advocate for the application of good-faith diplomacy and the increase in the number of refugees welcomed into the U.S.* ""

""INCREASED FUNDING FOR THE STATE DEPARTMENT""?!?!?! WHAT ABOUT THE WHOLE ""Alexandra stands in opposition to colonialism, imperialism, and all other violations to the right to self-determination in governance""???

""*Environmental Justice for Philly and Ending Food Insecurity. Alexandra will bring the fight against climate change to Philly by supporting green public housing projects, increasing access to healthy and sustainable food, and supporting grassroots activist efforts to end the environmental racism that puts Philly‚Äôs Black and low-income residents at a high risk of exposure to polluted air and water.*""

Where's the right to clean air and water?

However, so many people aren‚Äôt interested in thinking about this issue with any nuance or critical thinking at all; so many people just say, ‚ÄúWe should just ban trans people from sports,‚Äù completely ignoring the *years* of scientific research on HRT and its effects on athletic performance, the wealth of options available to us rather than just banning us completely, and, notably, the fact that trans people have been competing in sports for *decades* w/o a commensurate dominance at the highest levels.

1. The Italians were already working on improving their trains when Mussolini popped up, and 
2. The only trains running well were a few used by tourists and Italian elites

> ‚ÄúThe story that Mussolini made the trains run on time arose in the late ‚Äò20s and gained credence abroad mainly because of well-heeled British tourists who considered the hopelessly refractory Italians governable only by dictatorial means,‚Äù wrote Victoria de Grazia, a Columbia history professor, in The New York Times back in 1994. ‚ÄúHis regime built magnificent central stations and upgraded the main lines on which businessmen, politicians and comfort-minded tourists sped between Milan and Rome.‚Äù

However

> These direttissima (‚Äúmost direct‚Äù) lines, construction of which began before World War I, were engineering marvels; when it opened in 1934, the 11.5-mile double-tracked tunnel through the Apennines between Bologna and Florence was the second-longest in the world. (Nearly 100 workers were killed during its construction.) But Il Duce‚Äôs state-run railroads remained a mixed bag for most working men and women. ‚ÄúThe railroad workers' union was dissolved and nearly 50,000 employees were fired on political grounds,‚Äù de Grazia wrote. ‚ÄúThe toll for work accidents on heroic projects soared. As the direttissimi whizzed by on schedule, aged commuter locals filled with workers were shunted onto sidings.‚Äù"

Are you ignoring the question because you don't have an answer? Or do you have some other motivation to comment in a thread specifically about Trump's words in this interview?"

If we sanctioned everything in Russia and Putin still didn‚Äôt stop, then we‚Äôd have no choice to stop them, but start a war.

Diplomacy is still the best option though, who knows how Putin will twist the consequences of  sanctions using his media to push his own narrative to the citizens of Russia"
10778,"hy0bvbj",5,0,"/r/politics","There are several problems with a simple statement like ""forgive all the debt"".  As well as good examples of possible solutions for long term fixes going forward.

Here's a couple problems:

1.  Like it or not, people (adults) took on these loans.  It is ultimately the individual's responsibility to weigh all the possible repercussions of taking on such loans and their likelihood to be able to repay the loans.  Now there's a ton of factors there.  Like being ""oversold"" on the idea of the loans to begin with, being convinced to take the loans under pressure, cant get a job afterwards that pays enough, etc.  Lots of stuff that can be mitigating factors for the loan holders that work in their favor.  But even so they knowingly took on the loans.  I don't think complete loan forgiveness for everyone across the board is a good idea.  That is a serious moral hazard.  This is like the banks before 2008 taking the profits and making all the risks public.  It is by no means the same morally of course because college students don't generally take the loans assuming they will get bailed out.  But completely forgiveness is this type of hazard.  So the question is what level of responsibility does the loan holder have for taking the loan in the first place?  None?  Some?  All?

2. Less than half of Americans get college degrees.  Should the half that do not have college degrees foot the bill for those that do?  How about all the folks to went to trade schools and carry a debt?  How about folks who took any special training and had to pay out of their own pocket? Seems like they should get a break as well. Yes?  If not, why should their tax money go only to those who wanted to pay for college?

3. What responsibility do colleges/universities have?  Especially given they have jacked prices well beyond inflation over the last few decades.  Also, if the loans just get wiped out, it wont be the colleges that foot the bill.  It will be the government and therefore the tax payers.  Does this not incentive college to keep jacking prices to crazy levels knowing the gov will foot the bill?  Seem like that is a bad incentive structure.


Australia offers a possible solution:

* Loans are through the government.
* College pricing is limited to prevent issue #3 above.
* You only start paying back when you hit a certain income.
* If you never hit that income you never pay it back.
* Regardless, after a certain period of paying back, even if you have not paid it all back, the remainder is forgiven.

There are probably other solutions.  Certainly as many have said a good start is to just set interest to 0%.  But we need a system wide ""permanent"" fix.  And all these articles dont do a lot of problem solving.  They mostly just quote a bunch of folks saying all loans should be forgiven.  It's just low quality journalism in many cases."

10786,"hy196zq",5,0,"/r/politics",">It's not men v women, white v black, gay v straight, etc.

It's not *versus* anything. But women are the ones having their rights taken away. Being gay/trans is actively being legislated against. Black people, more so than white people, are imprisoned or extrajudicially murdered. 

There are no laws coming for white men *specifically*. And yet...conservatives act like white men are ""under attack."" The problem is when so many people believe that, and ignore the class issues. Because for a lot of them it's more important to attack women, gay people, and PoC. 

While I'm with you about the class issues, it's just kinda hard when you're trying to defend your personhood in *general* if you're female/PoC/LGBTQ."

If I were to operate a protest, the goal would be **silence**. Turn downtown into a nature reserve, not even the hum of an electric motor, just gridlocked. Be strategic, divert public necessities where needed most - ambulances good, cop cars bad. If shit got real intense, start... liberating, supply trucks like groceries, etc, and open public distribution centers."
