It makes his storyline more relevant IMO. I think people tend to forget that this was still the Skywalker saga and the battle between the family and Palpatine was the central theme. They didn’t flesh out Snoke enough for him to be an antagonist worth investing in like Palpatine either IMO. I also don’t really buy into the whole “it ruined Anakin’s actions” angle that people suggest because IMO that was always more so about balancing the force and redeeming his family than it was about saving the galaxy forever. He finally made the choice to be good, even if the world didn’t stay that way forever. Like him “killing” Palpatine was more symbolic than anything to me. 

I could see her being an Anakin 2.0 but I think that would make the repetitiveness complaints even stronger. I’d have accepted that too though. OP says there is no real evidence that she was a Palpatine prior, which is true, but I would say her conflict between the light and dark side was apparent from the start. More so than Anakin even, at that age. It’s all preference though. I loved that they did what they did so I’m admittedly biased.

I mean, it’s all good to expect it, place your bets accordingly. All I was ever pointing out was that you’re talking about two shows set far apart. Just because they share some characters and lore doesn’t ensure that one will will lead directly to the other.

The wealth of information available to people when viewing the world this way, to see things you could never view on your own from your time and position.

Meanwhile critical theory is based on confrontation, to look at all work and review why it isn't the way it should be, which means you already have an end point, a conclusion of what is right, that is always right, since everything else is judged by it's rubric, never to have its conclusions inspected itself or challenged.

Probably.The report specified it was a major character, as I recall. The only other possibilities I can think of are Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn (too handsome - ha!) or Weaving as Elrond (too rough around the edges). 

Odds are it's Frodo though. I think Wood is a great actor and does a good job, but he was **so** young (18 when filming began). The Frodo of the book is significantly tougher, more insightful and physically courageous. I'm sure Wood could have played it with more gravitas - you see glimpses of book-Frodo at various points, e.g. the confrontation with Boromir on Amon Hen - but the script plays up the character's youthfulness too. The end result is very different from the Frodo of the book and when the main character has been tweaked that much it really distorts aspects of the story.","was it wood as frodo

That said, both are made better because of the other. Din moves beyond being a cold blooded killer like he was before (referenced a bit in the jail break episode), and Grogu is opening up and finally gets to be a kid after decades of being on the run and trying to hide who he really is. 

They couldn’t have learned what was really important to them if this separation didn’t happen, and they wouldn’t have had a chance to grow while apart which they both did. Grogu leveled up, and I think Din is slowly realizing that he can no longer be satisfied with his old way of life even though he wants to cling to the familiar. Without Grogu he doesn’t have anything else except “the Job”.

I think there was some Disney execs that meddled with Boba Fett, and because they wanted the moneymakers in this show (Luke and Grogu) I get the impression that some things meant for S3 got rearranged to be the two episodes prior. I’m totally spitballing but I feel like the flashbacks to when Boba was a kid was gonna set up something that didn’t really get addressed, like how Boba began his path as a bounty hunter. Pure speculation, but it would account to some of the disjointed episodes.  All that said, I don’t think the time apart was cheapened, we always knew they’d get the band back togheter. Personally I have found it’s best to not judge media until it’s over, and since the Mandoverse extends over several shows I think it’s best to see it all as an arc, vs seeing the shows as stand alones.","i think it was definitely longer than a few weeks and i dont think it was all for nothing either grogu got to get back in touch with the force which is something din couldnt help him with luke was helping him remember he even said as much the problem though is luke cant really relate to him luke grew up with stern but loving parental figures in a stable environment as far as we know he didnt really get exposed to how horrible things could get until he saw his aunt and uncles bodies as an adult grogu and din have a lot in common both are foundlings that experienced seeing their primary care takes dins parents grogus jedi teachers murdered right in front of them and lost their childhood homes both were expected to follow a code grogu with the jedi way and din with the mandalorian deathwatch creed now as of this past season of the mandalorian s and book of boba fett now they are both exiled because they can no longer live up to expectations because of their relationship to one another that said both are made better because of the other din moves beyond being a cold blooded killer like he was before referenced a bit in the jail break episode and grogu is opening up and finally gets to be a kid after decades of being on the run and trying to hide who he really is

This is not correct. Tolkien wrote that this was his initial inspiration, yes, but also that his work moved well past this concept very quickly. Adhering to something Tolkien only started with and moved beyond, in such an absurdly literal way, as justification to castigate an adaptation for including people with relatively darker skin pigmentation, is absolutely deplorable.

ETA, a citation from Tolkien:

> Do not laugh! But once upon a time **(my crest has long since fallen)** I had a mind to make a body of more or less connected legend, ranging from the large and cosmogonic, to the level of romantic fairy-story - the larger founded on the lesser in contact with the earth, the lesser drawing splendour from the vast backcloths - which I could dedicate simply to: to England; to my country.

Emphasis mine. That's how it started. But that's not where the larger work ended up.

Also, Tolkien deplored racism, elevating one skin color above others. I am certain he would be utterly appalled by this controversy of casting a few POC actors for characters that weren't even in his mythos, but are inventions of the adaptors.","this is supposed to be english mythology from  years ago not a contemporary english society

It’s the same regurgitated “not staying true to Tolkien, no dwarf beards, elves aren’t black, etc.” I don’t necessarily disagree with these points but doesn’t mean it’s necessarily a sign that the overarching story is ruined. It seems some minor lore aspects were compromised for the sake of diversity. Yeah, it stings a bit when an adaption doesn’t stay entirely true to the source material but that’s rarely the case for most adaptions. There’s always compromises. Diversity/inclusivity is not the worst compromise. Very curious that no one ever gave a shit about bearded female dwarves until the the stills and trailer dropped and everyone realized they needed something to complain about. Other than that, the aesthetic isn’t that divorced from Jackson’s trilogy. One or two shots look strange but otherwise it looks aesthetically coherent.

Key difference is the sequels attempted to subvert audience expectations , knowing the division and debate it would cause, and then got scared of how heated it got and backtracked but it was too late. Rogue one is also widely regarded as better and now more popular. No one talks about the Sequels anymore , except to remind people they are bad. People still praise Rogue One. 

This show has real Tolkien historians and contributors helping make the project. They’re adapting a (somewhat) pre made story. They’re not going to subvert you. Nor are they going to hit you with “somehow Morgoth returned” with the full explanation being in Fortnite. 

Solo was shat on, similar to this, for months before release for various reasons. And I agree, it was a solid movie. It didn’t deserve the fear and sabotage it got before release. 

But see, the quality of the film changed your opinion right? How did it do that? You had to watch it and determine how you felt. Not go off of snippets and fans fear mongering the development. So at the base of this, I think you know that harsh judgment before release doesn’t actually dictate the products quality. And Solo had actual development hurdles while this show seemingly has gone very well BTS. 

But you are more emotionally attached to this product. So I sympathize with you. The fear of failure and the pre-emptive strikes are defense tactics so you won’t be hurt if it’s Rise of Skywalker meets Middle Earth. 

My earnest advise to you, from one Tolkien fan to another, is give it a chance like you did Solo. Breaking Bad writers are helping to create this. Tolkien experts are on set. If you give it an honest chance it may surprise you. 

If you personally cannot look past strict non canon interpretations just remind yourself it isn’t canon and never was meant to be canon.

21625,1,"/r/StarWars",0,"Rey's theme is connected to Palpatine's theme if you care to dig into music theory of the two songs. Though Rey's theme is connected to a lot of other Star Wars themes, but I think the connection to Palpatine's theme is the strongest.

We don't know the origins of Rey in TFA, but when we first see her she's inside the wreckage of Star Destroyer. And she learns the force quickly, remember Yoda's warning the that dark side is quicker?

Given the dark side Rey vision in RoS, I'm almost certain the plan was always for Rey to have had a connection to the Emperor and for her to go to the dark side in the second movie. That would be a great second movie twist, wouldn't it? 

But you don't want to give it away in the first movie, so they played the cards close to their chest in many respects. But someone gave John Williams the heads up so he could make Rey's theme able to transition to Palpatine's theme seamlessly, and they put a few things that would make sense if you watched it again knowing the twist. Like Rey's first appearance in the franchise taking place inside an old Star Destroyer. Rey is the legacy of the Emperor, and the location she first appears in is also the legacy of the Emperor.

Obviously, they chickened out on doing that. As a result, TLJ was basically pointless. And the audience found TLJ to be boring, because basically nothing happened. So then they brought JJ Abrams back to try to course correct back, but it was too late at that point.

Now I wouldn't go so far to say that they intended to actually bring Palpatine back in the flesh. Maybe his evil spirit or a hologram or whatever. But since Snoke was deleted as a character, they basically said ""fuck it, just bring back Palpatine"" because there wasn't much else to do at that point. 

Rey was meant to have some connection to the Emperor from the beginning, TLJ dropped that idea, dropped Snoke, dropped Luke Skywalker, and after the Carrie Fisher died, there wasn't really anything that could be done other than schlock. And nobody does schlock better than Palpatine. And since Rey was meant to be connected to Palpatine anyway, they did that too. Though it wasn't possible to have that story really work in one movie, but what else could they do?","reys theme is connected to palpatines theme if you care to dig into music theory of the two songs though reys theme is connected to a lot of other star wars themes but i think the connection to palpatines theme is the strongest

Boba Fett is a changed man. His experience at the hands of the Tuskens was initially humiliating, but he came to respect them and they him. Good concept, and the fact that they are killed is then what drives forward his next actions.

The only major flaw I personally saw in his actions was the way he gunned the biker gang down from behind. While I get that he wants revenge, it feels pretty low (and against his new character) to do it that way. 

Secondly, if I’ve understood it properly, part of Boba’s story is about setting up the Mandalorian’s motivations. Mando’s story in this series mirrors that of Boba: having completed his quest he returns to bounty hunting as the only way of life he knows. Manages to find his tribe, but is then outcast for not following their rules. The starfighter signifies the transformation of Din from a bounty hunter into a Jedi-like heroic figure. Ironically, he’s far more at home with the reformed Boba than he is with his own tribe of Mandalorians. He also now has an example of someone who has gone from being a bounty hunter to a leader and shares a similar moral compass.

Finally, Luke Skywalker. At the end of episode 6 he tells Grogu that for him, a few years will be a lifetime for others. I am fairly sure that he was telling Grogu to follow his heart and go and spend time with Din. Din will surely die and Grogu will go on living for another 700+ years. There’s plenty of time for him to become a Jedi, but it won’t be as Luke’s student.

As for hatred of polytheism, monotheism is not henotheism. No monotheistic religion outright condones the concept. Jews think of everyone else to be in error, only that Jewish proselytization stopped because of various reasons, including losing their state. Same with Christians and Muslims.

Like Jesus Christ from the very moment episode started, you could FEEL Rodriguez in every shot. He's alright, but God, it was all over the place.

And there were a bit of very awkward shots that kinda spoiled the flow of the episode. Like Mando just casually walking away from still alive droid that just almost killed him. That took away the immersion completely in the moment. Then the Freetown folk started shooting at the rancor they saw Boba was riding so it was friendly, just why?

And then overall I think that Cad was brought in for fanservice reasons because there wasn't any meaningful outcome from him. Yeah a few banter shots with Boba but... was that just it?

Now I wasn't complaining about Mando being in the show before but the way they ended it, I am now convinced that it's just a connection show for Mando season 3. Because it ended on Mando just flying away. Not even on Boba. It's just this part specifically rubbed wrong on me.

I hope season 2 is going to be less of a connection show but more of standalone story. And I do hope Rodriguez gets the boot because... well, yeah. His episodes are my least favourite in the show simply because of how they were filmed.

44711,1,"/r/lotr",1,"I agree. There are valid criticisms of the teaser. 

For instance, when Galadriel was climbing the wall, it truly looked inauthentic. I was promptly schooled that the shot was actually practical, but that doesn’t mean anything to me. The end result was something that looked straight out of a video game and as fake as one. If you’re using practical effects and it still comes out looking shitty, maybe rethink the camera you are filming with, or the lighting, or something. People can only judge what you give them and despite it being practical, it easily looks like bad CGI. That shot and the troll stood out. You can’t get upset at people expecting more when you were flaunting your $1 billion dollar budget. House of the Dragon had a tenth of that in budget and still had better visuals in its teaser. 

In my opinion, people complaining about the lack of beards, Celebrimbor being old, short-haired elves, and Elrond’s Elvis Presley blowout are being a little nit picky. If the show is good, I really don’t think those things are going to ruin it, but this is all people have, so they can complain about it.

So that's their goal, they're not claiming to have succeeded, but that's the ambition they're striving towards. And looking at Tolkien's notes and how the lore changed I think there is absolutely at least 1 ""novel Tolkien never wrote"" in the sense of a story he clearly intended to tell but wasn't given the chance. In my opinion, that story is of the Blue Wizards in Rhûn, which he ties so many fascinating and important ideas to that I think he must have intended to write a great deal more about them. 

The Second Age as a whole is likely a story Tolkien wanted to tell, but he wrote less of it than the 1st or 3rd Ages. These showrunners are doubtless trying to decipher what story Tolkien might have written about the Second Age, and how he might tell it were he still alive today. I do not know how else we could possibly expect them to approach writing a television series about the events of the Second Age.

The story of Middle-earth, if it was intended to be a mythology for England (a claim intensely contested by Tolkien scholars), would not have been a mythology specifically for the England of 1914-1973. It would, as myths usually are, be intended for all future generations as well. So, it is not a contradiction for a depiction of Middle-earth to represent the wide variety of people who currently live in England, except where the lore explicitly contradicts it (dark Silvan Elves do not) or where it would damage the great themes that Tolkien wove through his stories. 

Themes that the showrunners appear to understand:  ""It’s about friendship and it’s about brotherhood and underdogs overcoming great darkness.”

 I am skeptical that Amazon will stay true to the theme of Power Corrupts, being owned by the richest man on the planet, but only time will tell.","the full quote is    the driving question behind the production he adds was this can we come up with the novel tolkien never wrote and do it as the megaevent series that could only happen now

- Rancor, obviously badass.  Much higher intelligence level than anticipated, as he's the first Boba ally to utilize higher ground.  Albiet, with no ranged weapon equipped, but he's got the spirit.  Remember using jetpacks to land in the middle of an open plaza?

- Robot 2 follows the fleeing crowd down a boulevard, can't hit a single one.  I guess there was no need for them to scatter...

- Like, why even have a single pyke trooper?  Just send in the 2 robots from the beginning

- mod gang the worst characters in SW?  Idk, but in the conversation

- 2 gamorians were as usefull as womp rats.  At least loyal, but didnt even take a single dude with them as they plunged.  Tough L

- Imagine having a rancor and it not being Plan A, Plan B, and Plan C...

- Once the shields go down on the 2nd robot, no a single person continues to fire their blasters at it.  Only when the shields are up is that allowed?

- Peli is a top tier character tho, have to give her credit.

- 2 flames to the face and he runs off...

- Lol dont duel cad when youre fresh.  Tire yourself out, then try to outdraw him with a blaster rifle???

- Knee rockets up the Thanus would've been better, but the tusken stab to the chest is plenty satisfying

-  Mando not cut out for the rodeo apparently, guess he should've grabbed Cad's hat first

- Gotta upgrade to Cad's flame juice.  Couldn't tank 2 spurts, but he can drink mando's right down the hatch with no problem

- (Flashes to the leaders) Lemme guess, Fennec kills everyone 

-  AAarrghgrh rhg why is their entire leadership exposed?? Why was assassination not Plan A??

- Destroying ""his city"" full of ""his people"" that he met like a month ago.  Btw, these people probably hated and killed tuskens, the other ""his people""??

36605,1,"/r/lotr",1,"I actually had an interesting realization reading/translating the poem during my recent, more experiencd, reread

When I first heard the last two lines I translated it to mean:

 'farewell! Perhaps you shall find Valimar! Perhaps even you shall find it! Farewell!'

Which was sentimental enough for me when I was a kid, understanding that Galadriel simply 'hoped' that someday Frodo would succeed- ('It is my hope that you will prevail!)

But as I thought about the 'perhaps' part (meaning it may or may not, but I hope), I got more into the translation, and read that some translate it as 'may it be' (meaning a genuine wish, or prayer- I want you to see Valimar!) So Galadriel *wants this*. She *prays* it will happen, not just that she is bidding Frodo good luck.

 Then, after reading the Silmarillion, and realizing what Valimar is, and the Mythos, and understanding the nature of Galadriel's plight, I realized it was more of an amalgam- a hope/wish/prayer/desire for them both:

**'I want you to see Valimar! I pray that you will see it, because that means you have succeeded, and evil is gone from this place, and all my long years will not have been in vain, and that, I too, will once again look upon Valimar, the home of my upbringing, and that your soul will again find peace for such a noble deed.'**

I love that transition I've went through. From a simple 'good luck', to a 'I want you to succeed, and wish you well', to a, 'if you succeed, and I hope you will, the world will be set right, and the sins of my kin will be accounted for, and you and the whole world shall find peace! - Oh how I wish you will succeed! Farewell!'

It speaks volumes that, Galadriel, who knows so very much, would let him know that, although she does not know his own fate, she *wishes* (may it be) that Frodo finds Valimar, not only for him, but for her, and the fate of all middle earth. Much more than *just* a compassionate 'farewell.'","i actually had an interesting realization readingtranslating the poem during my recent more experiencd reread

Ethnicity is a grouping who identify with each other on the basis of shared attributes; most predominantly being traditions, language, religion, culture, nation or social treatment. It is recognised as a social construct, not biological. 

This is precisely why we see **ethnogenesis** in the first place; the formation and development of an ethnic group. This phenomenon happens in a multitude of ways; via language shift, acculturation, adoption and religious conversion.

Some ethnic groups may separate themselves from endogamy or physical separation from their parent group or conversely, separate ethnicities can merge together to form a pan or single ethnicity. Group identity is never static.


Organ donations are based on blood and tissue types; none of which are going to be used to define ethnicities. You know, 'cause there are only four main blood types and Type-O the most *compatible* is most commonly found in Aborigines, Bororo, Green/Icelanders, Nicobarese and Peruvians. That's a spread across multiple races.

Literal quote from the Human Genome Project: ""DNA studies do not indicate that separate classifiable subspecies (races) exist within modern humans. While different genes for physical traits such as skin and hair colour can be identified between individuals, *no consistent patterns of genes across the human genome exist to distinguish one race from another.* **There also is no genetic basis for divisions of human ethnicity.**""

You can do your 23andme test, it tells you is a composition based on haplogroups. What's going to be your minimum allowed proportion to certain markers?

You're really getting in a twist here; putting random time limits on nativity and ancestry and now trying to associate entire racial groups along with genetics which there is no scientific basis for(they've actually rejected that idea). You're describing ethnonationalism. Enjoy that hill.

Yes it is. The concept of making something more inclusive is a ideological idea. No skin color wans't a big deal to him but it is to Amazon, If it wasn't they wouldn't feel the need to be inclusive. Inclusivity is a racialy conscious concept. To Tolkien the idea that you need to consciously seek to include people of various real world skin colors would have been as strange as saying Beowulf or the Mahabarata need to be more inclusive.

30135,1,"/r/lotr",1,"That was one of the LOTR movie changes I dd not like.

Before the LOTR movies came out, there were things about the movie which ""leaked"". People saw a greater role for Arwen, etc.. There was a fair amount of controversy amongst Tolkien fans over it all. Sound familiar? Remember, at the time there were no ""movie fans"" yet.

Anyway, some of the changes I've come to accept, some I like, and some I still do not like.

The explanation for the rather dramatic Faramir changes was that a lot of his conflict and decision making in the book was internal and impossible to convey onscreen. I think the changes were way more than needed for that and that the time taken for the extra little Faramir story told could have been better used with more ""cannon"" narratives. But that's just me.

Something to think about presently... some things I thought were horrible before the fact (and even at first) I have come to really like about the movies. For instance, the drawn out agonizing over Arwen giving up her immortality actually including her starting for the Grey Havens was done well. The expanded love story between her and Aragorn in general was not bad. Her having  more action role, I still do not like. Save that for Eowyn.","that was one of the lotr movie changes i dd not like

You've yet to show me what makes an English ethnicity via genetics.

This is why we see ethnogenesis in the first place; the formation and development of an ethnic group. This phenomenon happens in a multitude of ways; via language shift, acculturation, adoption and religious conversion. 

Some ethnic groups may separate themselves from endogamy or physical separation from their parent group or conversely, separate ethnicities can merge to form pan or single ethnicity.

I’m never one to turn my nose up at Star Wars, so overall I had a great time. My one true complaint about the show is the Mando/Luke episodes completely shafting the finale. If you’re gonna do a Boba show do a Boba show. Don’t dedicate 2 episodes to the characters from your already existing wildly popular TV show and expect people to temper down for one odd episode afterwards. What’s more, those episodes kind of made Din and Grogu major players in the finale. Din I understand, but Grogu really and no reason to be incorporated into the action.

Given maybe one additional episode I feel like there could have been both a diplomatic/political resolution to the conflict as well as a physical resolution. There was a whole lot here that didn’t go anywhere. Boba never proved himself to be up to the task of a crime lord. He really didn’t react much to the news of the Tuskens (or at least he didn’t any differently on this information than he would have without knowing it).

Similarly, when Sauron is perceived he ""met his match"" in Galadriel, this needs to be understood in light of Tolkiens broader descriptions of Sauron as a sorceror and deceiver, not a military commander. Even for Morgoth, the balrogs were used as his military commanders while Sauron was valued for his sorcery and ability to organize and govern.   


Nothing in your quotes really suggests it is consistent with Galadriels character or history to have led armies into battles as a regular general.","who together with the greatest of all the eldar luthien tinuviel daughter of elu thingol are the chief matter of the legends and histories of the elves

34488,1,"/r/lotr",1,">some things are worth fighting for

I don’t see this sentiment in the novel at all. 

Tolkien makes it pretty clear that he despises all warfare and all violence, and that all characters who regard warfare and ‘attacking’ as anything but the very last defensive resort are corrupted in some way. 

The mythos is full of characters convinced that they need to *fight* for something (such as Feanor+Sons, Thorin, Boromir) and they are all wrong, or they all beget tragedy. Whereas all characters that seek knowledge over retribution, that choose exile over confrontation, that choose conversation over violence, are good and right.

The very setting that sets this novel apart is that in spite of everything, we are witnessing *The Long Defeat*. 

*Fighting* is something imposed by orcish folk upon others. Never anything else.

Now of course you can take ‘fighting’ as any and all sort of heroic endeavour, meaning ‘some things are worth enduring hardships for’, but that’s just base DNA for *all* hero stories, as without this there can be no hero stories.

If ‘Some things are worth fighting for!’ was a main theme of the books, Frodo would have taken up his sword during the Scouring of the Shire. But he didn’t.

‘Some things are worth giving your life to’, definitely. But fighting is not the right word at all.","some things are worth fighting for

Many times Morgoth essayed to smite him, and each time Fingolfin leaped away...; and he wounded Morgoth with seven wounds, and seven times Morgoth gave a cry of anguish, whereat the hosts of Angband fell upon their faces in dismay, and the cries echoed in the Northlands.

But at the last the King grew weary, and Morgoth bore down his shield upon him. Thrice he was crushed to his knees, and thrice arose again and bore up his broken shield and stricken helm. But the earth was all... pitted about him, and he stumbled and fell backward before the feet of Morgoth; and Morgoth set his left foot upon his neck.... Yet with his last and desperate stroke Fingolfin hewed the foot with Ringil, and the blood gushed forth black and smoking and filled the pits of Grond.

Thus died Fingolfin, High King of the Noldor, most proud and valiant of the Elven-kings of old. The Orcs made no boast of that duel at the gate; neither do the Elves sing of it, for their sorrow is too deep. Yet the tale of it is remembered still, for Thorondor King of Eagles brought the tidings to Gondolin, and to Hithlum afar off. And Morgoth took the body of the Elven-king and broke it, and would cast it to his wolves; but Thorondor came hasting from his eyrie among the peaks of the Crissaegrim, and he stooped upon Morgoth and marred his face. The rushing of the wings of Thorondor was like the noise of the winds of Manwë, and he seized the body in his mighty talons, and soaring suddenly above the darts of the Orcs he bore the King away. And he laid him upon a mountain-top that looked from the north upon the hidden valley of Gondolin; and Turgon coming built a high cairn over his father. No Orc dared ever after to pass over the mound of Fingolfin or draw nigh his tomb, until the doom of Gondolin was come and treachery was born among his kin. Morgoth went ever halt of one foot after that day, and the pain of his wounds could not be healed; and in his face was the scar that Thorondor made.

Lmao, uh no. If you've seen anything of JJ Abrams you know he throws a bunch of questions up in the air and it's usually up to whoever comes afterward to answer and tie things together. Apparently the one time before TRoS he actually finished something he took the story back to the status quo, aka undoing everything that was said previous... Just like TRoS.

I always bring up this analogy when it comes to writing a three-part story or trilogy. If I came to you and said that I wanted you to write the middle part of the story and I told you

>""Once upon a time there was a man named Larry. Larry was pretty hungry and his favorite food was pasta, so he went to the store.""

what would you write? Well honestly you could write about anything as long as it related to what I had. You can write about how he buys ingredients for Kraft mac and cheese. You can maybe change some things up and say that he makes some kind of vietnamese dish. You can even add ingredients and spices and other dishes no one was expecting. Either way, it builds from before and though some people won't agree with what dish you choose, you still managed to tie it together.

who do you blame for fucking up the story? Yes, you could certainly blame the idea that nothing was planned from the start and that it was maybe not the smartest idea for you to finish the middle part and for me to finish the first and last part. However, it doesn't take a genius to build upon previous storylines and come up with a satisfying conclusion. Rian Johnson set up several storylines and story beats as a jumping off point for a new story, regardless if you agreed with any of them or not. JJ Abrams just decided to ignore most of it, retcon some of it, and then go off the wall bonkers with a twist that made absolutely no sense.

He is mostly at fault.

""The dwarves of course are quite obviously, wouldn't you say that in many ways they remind you of the Jews? Their words are Semitic, obviously, constructed to be Semitic.""

Shortly after The Hobbit, which Tolkien intended as a sort of romanticization of jewish culture, Hitler, WW2 and the Holocaust happened. And Tolkien felt terribly, because he realized that a lot of the things he enshrined as characteristic of the dwarves/jews were stereotypes that were weaponized against the jewish people and that he was perpetuating ideas that, regardless of his own intention, had negative effects. So, as he did with so many other things, he retconed much about the dwarves to better reflect what he *intended* for people to take from his work.

39009,1,"/r/lotr",1,"Okay. Let’s go then. Maybe I misinterpreted it. That would be nice to honestly speak with someone who can speak back, candidly. 
1.)Time compression - and although I understand the purpose, I’m really not a fan of what they’re doing with it.
2.) Galadriel did not participate in many, if any of the battles that they’re posturing her for in the series. It seems disingenuous and like they’re trying to make a Terminaterette for the sake of having a “strong female.” It’s cool to have a tough-but-human character of any breed, but to ram an established one down our throat and say “it’s been wrong this whole time” is cheap.
3.) I am more of the school of thought that since they referenced a lot of the “main elves” with long hair and not designer haircuts, that it’s another creative liberty that I don’t particularly care for. I understand the current climate and why they would want to do it. I am just not a fan of the actions taken with it. Does it destroy story lines? No, but I feel that it cheapens the overall production. If you’re trying to build in a world that is already largely established, you should probably play along with what has been accepted into the world to a large degree rather than to take new liberties and try to find some vague supporting letter that justifies a counter argument and make things feel more alien.
4.) next I will move to what I believe is most likely the fault of the green-screen but will admit that we do not yet have the final word as the “polished product” is not available yet. Everyone everything is cleaned to the nines. You’re going to tell me adventurers look like they come out of a hot-spring bath in every scene? I hope that’s not the case. The jury is still out, but I’m not left with much faith.
5.) this one will ruffle feathers and here’s where the scree-ree downvotes come. If I tell you a race is deprived of sunlight, do you picture sun kissed skin? With a basic understanding of human biology, I would think not. Melanin is an adaptation of environment and although there are mutations that you can cherry pick from (such as “gingers” living in the Middle East, which still hold controversy as to whether that’s authentic or a product of US meddling “foreign policy”). As a person that believes in basic biology, I believe that an explanation to any deviation would require an explanation on lineage or ethnicity (do like Tolkien has done with everything else) that would be explained in a “bio-chapter.” Otherwise once again, it feels cheapened and more so rammed down our throats and told to “accept it bigot.” Could it be explained away? Yes. Do I think they will? No. I think it will be most likely like everything else so far and people will be harassed for wanting answers on creative choice.
6.) Beards. No it is not the dealbreaker but finding one piece of literature that contradicts all of the literature does NOT explain away the creative liberties taken. Once again, this comes across as disingenuous and more as a creative liberty that is being rammed down our throat to support an existing sociopolitisphere that would potentially attract more people at the cost of the people who know and love Tolkien’s work.

46118,1,"/r/lotr",1,"Sure race is a social construct but now we are just debating definitions. But people of different ethnic backgrounds have direct appearances. Someone from Ireland looks different from someone from Arabia. Someone from Japan looks differ from someone from the Philippines. Someone from Somalia looks different from someone from Morocco. It would be goofy if filming a movie that takes place in a historical time in Ireland and have a large portion of the cast played by Arabs. And again tolkin described  what many of these ethnic groups looked like in the books, the vast majority of people living in those communities are going to look like those descriptions. It would be equally goofy of a large portion of the rohirrim were played by Somalian actors with dreadlocks. Sure does it change the story? No. and could the producer do that, I guess, but something like that goes against what the books say so expect some blow back from fans. The past was not a cosmopolitan melting pot like modern day New York. Only some major cities and ports throughout history fit a similar profile, but that’s not the world that middle earth described. Now the reactions to this Amazon series might be pre mature, but the reason many of use are concerned is because there is this prevailing belief and movement to diversify media among modern concepts of race.

Of course, you'll note what's happened here isn't ""a deviation from the source material"", it's inventing something out of nowhere, which surely must serve some narrative purpose.

It's also important to remember that concrete planning of a trilogy is potentially dangerous and writers need to be flexible. Let's not forget that Carrie Fisher died shortly before TLJ was released, so any already planned Ep IX was going to need to undergo a significant re-write. 
 
And whilst we all know the OT wasn't planned at all, the extent to which the PT was planned out is overstated. Characters and events underwent significant changes during development in between Episodes (it benefitted of course from having an ending that had already been written in the OT).
 
The ST isn't perfect, but I love it because every one of the films does something which gets to the heart of what Star Wars is about. And for TRoS that is the exploration of heritage and destiny: no matter where we've come from, we get to choose our direction. Whether that's our family heritage (Skywalker/Palpatine) or the heritage of the Jedi/Sith. I have issues with how we get there in the film, but the final third is fantastically executed and hits all the right notes for those themes.","all excellent points

There is hardly ever foreshadowing so heavy handed and obvious that it undoubtedly foretells what could easily be described as a major plot twist. We didn't see something spelled out, but yet there were definitely people predicting it long before it was canon.

There are plenty of hints that Reys parents weren't actually nobody  and everyone took Kylos single line in TLJ as God's honest truth without considering the source. It was still true that a Jedi was not defined by their birth or their parents, but by themselves. It just turned out that he was being a dismissive edgelord by telling her that her parents were nobodies. 

So there, TFA and TLJ (yes even despite Kylos single line) both had parts that suggested Reys heritage was significant, and even suggested it was something she was fighting with. That suggests the return of a major character not already accounted for, pretty much leaving Vader and Palp, both assumed dead before having a daughter. Lots of people speculated Obi-Wan too I think, but that was about it for significant possibilities from the only known surviving canon time-line. 

When everything HAS to be inextricably and permanently bound to the tropes and significant characters of one set of now classic movies, well there just isn't any real room for growth. It's kinda sad that the fan base couldn't take. Rians gentle commentary a little more maturely, but that is what he suggests that their problem has always been after all. Tied so completely to the dogma and structure of the glorious past, they simply can't move on to become something more, even though that path obviously must lead to extinction.","always looking for a new way to complain the last one was awful it was good for nothing rian should have done all three

Now if only Disney had that respect for George Lucas's stories when they were writing the Sequel Trilogy... But it will be interesting to see where Amazon go with this.

But then I think Peter Jackson needs a bit of a reality check here. Many of the characters in his film adaptions didn't exactly follow the novels that closely.

\-Gimli was turned into comic relief  
\-Legolas was turned into a some sort of Kung Fu panda caricature   
\-Faramir didn't desire power (and his character was written as a reflection of the Gondorians who remained loyal to the Valar after the fall of Numenor). Jacksons portrayal of the humans is a bit one dimensional.  
\-Denethor wasn't incompetent - he was a brilliant strategist but succumbed to using a palantir  which allowed Sauron to manipulate his mental state.   
\-Gandalf in RotK looks really inept at times rather than the architect behind the downfall of Sauron - though it was obviously a decision made to shine the spotlight on Aragorn

13390,1,"/r/StarWars",0,"For a show with ""Star Wars"" moniker the street battle seemed rather badly coordinated on both sides. Like why not have Slave 1 overhead as close air support? The Syndicate appeared to arrive with public transports, so lack local star ship cover. The Large droids could act as AA to disable starships. Whether holing up in a Cantina or a castle or a surveyor office, you're not going to abandon your HQ without sentries and snipers setup in strategic locations. If posting lookouts you post maybe one or two in each static location then run patrols between them. 

I don't have a problem with the Mods, I have a problem with the mods on Tatooine: they're too clean and brightly dressed. The Vespa theme for their bikes works better in a less desert environment. If the show was on the streets of Coruscant, they'd be fine and fit right in with the tapestry. Plus their bikes go way too slow. They're a group that favors style over substance and that undermines the harshness of Tatooine.

It's Mos Espa, not Coruscant: the gangs and crime lords operate openly. There's no need to try to blend in with the crowd, there's not any kind of police force. The extremely small forces involved really makes it seem small. That's probably the most offputting thing of the whole show IMHO. Jabba had barge and a castle full of people. Under Fortuna those would have dimished as would the seat at the crime table. But Boba really operated without any allies in large numbers. Maybe the story overall was poorly conceived or Covid restrictions reduced their scope in casting. But it makes it hard to think of a ""crime lord"" operating with himself, a lieutenant and a pair of enforcers and somehow putting pressure on the streets. It would have made just as much sense to introduce a town militia who would be called on to defend against Sand People attacks, which Boba Fett negotiates a peace between, and they come to his aid at the end instead of the people of Free Town, despite how much I enjoy the character and performer of Cobb. 

In fact I expected some kind of wider connection to Sand People cooperating through the influence of Fett, to tie the whole story together, instead of it establish why he has a stick. Thematically Fett should have found he liked being apart of the Sand people, but when the spice and galactic culture clash, and his tribe is lost, he picks up the mantle in order to resolve the differences and preserve Sand People cultures and lives. As a crime lord, he can do more to reign in criminal activity harming Sandpeople and the people of Tattoine in general than any political office, and his direct violence would allow a quick shake up of power structures. But overall the story gets muddled.

I say all this and I enjoyed the performances, and getting to see the characters and interactions, and attribute the weaknesses as being a result of Covid shaking up the production cycle and schedule.","for a show with star wars moniker the street battle seemed rather badly coordinated on both sides like why not have slave  overhead as close air support the syndicate appeared to arrive with public transports so lack local star ship cover the large droids could act as aa to disable starships whether holing up in a cantina or a castle or a surveyor office youre not going to abandon your hq without sentries and snipers setup in strategic locations if posting lookouts you post maybe one or two in each static location then run patrols between them

in fact i expected some kind of wider connection to sand people cooperating through the influence of fett to tie the whole story together instead of it establish why he has a stick thematically fett should have found he liked being apart of the sand people but when the spice and galactic culture clash and his tribe is lost he picks up the mantle in order to resolve the differences and preserve sand people cultures and lives as a crime lord he can do more to reign in criminal activity harming sandpeople and the people of tattoine in general than any political office and his direct violence would allow a quick shake up of power structures but overall the story gets muddled

i say all this and i enjoyed the performances and getting to see the characters and interactions and attribute the weaknesses as being a result of covid shaking up the production cycle and schedule"

I figured we would see a show down between Boba Fett and Cad Bane with Boba winning.   No way would we see the Pykes prevail.  I did not expect to see Han Solo or Chewbacca, or even Luke.   Remember, while they are heroes in our story, Mando, Fett, and Fennec are all garbage from the point of view of Luke and the Republic.  They are the villains from a certain point of view.   


I am somewhat disappointed to see the Gamorean Guards die, I really feel like they could have been expanded and humanized a bit like we have seen with the Tuskins.

I do hope we get a season 2 with Boba turning his position into a money making empire.  The surviving characters are rather cool.    


I wonder if Mando Season 3 is going to take place right after the second rescue of Grogu.  Where Mando and Bo-Katan are on the ship they commandeered.   For as cool as the N-1 Starfighter is that Mando has, its not a residence, it doesn't have a place for him to keep all his stuff, or sleep, or take a shit, or carry bounties.   Maybe he will still be using the ship as his base of operations and then leaving in the N-1 to go on missions.

29513,1,"/r/lotr",1,"This is correct. Their names and words are all rendered in Old English in the text for this reason. Rohan represents Tolkien's retrospective ideal ""alternate history"" for Anglo-Saxon Britain. In particular, the development of a strong heavy-cavalry tradition. In his estimation, this would have allowed Harold II Godwinson and the Saxons to defeat William the Bastard and the Normans at the Battle of Hastings, thus preserving the original Germanic quality of the English language.

Gothic names and words do come up in the Legendarium, but are used to render the language of the Northmen of Rhovanion. Tolkien made these Goths and their Norse cousins (the Men of Dale) not only friends of the Roman Empire (Gondor), but also continental. Thus, these Northmen not only conduct no sea raids, they also form neither Danelaw nor destabilize Catholicism's anointed empire. Win-win for an English Catholic Germanic philologist.

In the conceit of the lore, Rohirric, Dalish, and ""Northmannish"" are all related linguistically as tongues of Middle Men (as are their rendered counterparts - Old English, Old Norse, and Gothic). ""Northmannish"" is closest to Adunaic (and therefore Westron - Modern English).

What was supposed to be the climax: taking out the Pyke Syndicate devolved into a minute long scene of Fennec assassinating the leader, maybe they should have done that sooner, did they not interrogated the major's spokesperson to get their location before now?

Anyways when's Mando S3","not a fan of this episode to be honest im sorry but mr spy kids shouldnt be a director the sequence trying to take out those two metal droids was far too long and having the characters just dance around them again and again really cheapened how intimidating the droids were supposed to be

32013,1,"/r/lotr",1,"> It isn't a matter of implication. Christopher literally says there's an error and that that line was supposed to say Noldor, but a mistake was made in editing.

But what that error implies, or does not, is what we are debating. You believe it implies one thing which I believe makes no logical sense within the context. Your entire argument hinges on a tiny technicality your layering your theories on top of. Yes, I can see how you could technically justify your idea. But I, and clearly many others, don't find that to be the logical conclusion.

> I mean that black and brown dwarves are not only possible, but more likely than not.

Actually they're far less likely than not if you understand how and why different skin tones develope. Dwarves spend the vast majority their lives underground. And dwarf women almost never come above ground. You could argue they aren't ""white"", but they would still be very pale.

> The only reason I can think of for not wanting black dwarves is an aversion to them.

This is very closed minded and a straw man. You really should work on your ability to see things from the point of view of others. I can see you really want to project some kind of racism going on here, but it only exists in your own head. No one is arguing against the existence of Easterlings or Haradrim. These two cultures would have been an excellent place to expand into instead of messing with things.

> If we want to address the fact that only 1/3 of dwarves are women...

Your point isn't relevant. Your deflecting. With only a third being female, there would be significantly less diversity in the species. Tolkien makes the point that they only ever multiplied slowly, then were dwindling.

> She is referred to as Thorin's sister, but Frodo is referred to as Bilbo's nephew and is his adopted son.

The are clear as day family trees Tolkien created that addresses this point. Dis and Thorin II are two of the three children of Thrain II. By the way, Dis is not Disa from the preview. It looks like they stole her name for the new series.

> I'm not sure how 80% can be white in general.

Then you need to research how ethnicity works. You can belong to more than one group. Like I said, the 58% is ""white alone"". Granted ""white"" isn't actually an ethnicity because it contains many ethnicities under that umbrella term, but it is treated as such.

For a final time, and for clarity's sake, the people who have a problem with the casting love the lore tolkien created and it is for the love of that lore that they disagree with the choices. Nothing more, nothing less. If the only thing you can imagine is a distaste for black characters, that is a flaw in you, not them. I feel comfortable speaking for those arguing the same as I, we have no issue with black characters. But an internally consistent world, such as the one tolkien created, should be preserved as such. Otherwise it detracts from the quality of the project.","it isnt a matter of implication christopher literally says theres an error and that that line was supposed to say noldor but a mistake was made in editing

but what that error implies or does not is what we are debating you believe it implies one thing which i believe makes no logical sense within the context your entire argument hinges on a tiny technicality your layering your theories on top of yes i can see how you could technically justify your idea but i and clearly many others dont find that to be the logical conclusion

 i mean that black and brown dwarves are not only possible but more likely than not

actually theyre far less likely than not if you understand how and why different skin tones develope dwarves spend the vast majority their lives underground and dwarf women almost never come above ground you could argue they arent white but they would still be very pale

 the only reason i can think of for not wanting black dwarves is an aversion to them

this is very closed minded and a straw man you really should work on your ability to see things from the point of view of others i can see you really want to project some kind of racism going on here but it only exists in your own head no one is arguing against the existence of easterlings or haradrim these two cultures would have been an excellent place to expand into instead of messing with things

 if we want to address the fact that only  of dwarves are women

your point isnt relevant your deflecting with only a third being female there would be significantly less diversity in the species tolkien makes the point that they only ever multiplied slowly then were dwindling

 she is referred to as thorins sister but frodo is referred to as bilbos nephew and is his adopted son

the are clear as day family trees tolkien created that addresses this point dis and thorin ii are two of the three children of thrain ii by the way dis is not disa from the preview it looks like they stole her name for the new series

 im not sure how  can be white in general

then you need to research how ethnicity works you can belong to more than one group like i said the  is white alone granted white isnt actually an ethnicity because it contains many ethnicities under that umbrella term but it is treated as such

for a final time and for claritys sake the people who have a problem with the casting love the lore tolkien created and it is for the love of that lore that they disagree with the choices nothing more nothing less if the only thing you can imagine is a distaste for black characters that is a flaw in you not them i feel comfortable speaking for those arguing the same as i we have no issue with black characters but an internally consistent world such as the one tolkien created should be preserved as such otherwise it detracts from the quality of the project"

WTF is the truth about the Fremen, spice, and worms? The movie didn't really portray any of that. It really blew through a lot of that intrigue.

12485,1,"/r/StarWars",0,"Overall:

-	This show is hard to assess. Very disappointing start and, as a character, I think Boba only drew into focus in the final ep. This show simultaneously had some of the best content of the Disney era but failed at being what it was billed as. The mid-season pivot saved the show - but also felt like everyone gave up on the elevator pitch as a compelling prospect. Which feels like a shame. 
-	The Mandalorian is an amazing character - I think they’ve created an icon - the extent to which I only realised seeing him carry an ep outside his own show, without Baby Yoda. 
-	Likewise - we are all gonna be living with versions of Grogu for, what, the next 30 years?
-	The Rancor VFX were astonishing - especially given it was all daylight, plain view. Feels like a gamechanger for TV. 
-	Speaking of FX work, Cad Bane is amazing practical make-up and prosthetic work. I don’t think he would have had half the presence as a mocap character, as good as that tech is. The team absolutely knocked it out the park when it came to realising him on screen. 
-	The CG Luke stuff is interesting but dramatically limited. It’s an incredible achievement but I think may damage the character if overused. Hamill’s a good actor and has always been very expressive - the achievement they made here is impressive but it isn’t sustainable to have a Luke that can only operate as an actor at like 5% of Mark’s range. 
-	Windu for season 2 is essential - and would give Temura something dramatic and meaty to sink his teeth into. That’s a real redemption arc - for Boba and Mace both - there for the taking. The visual of a fucked up, ancient Mace Windu - broken and defeated but still capable of kicking ass - is calling to me. 
-	I hope the production value of Kenobi and Andor is more like Book’s second half than the first. Would love to know what happened behind the scenes here as, as much as the writing didn’t help, the first half of this show looked so empty and underbaked.
-	As a director, Rodriguez redeemed himself. This ep I think could have had a tighter pace in the first half but some of the action beats were amazing. I’m guessing this series really struggled with covid protocols early on or something.","overall

Doriath was by far the most strongest realm of Elves cuz it had a literal Maia in it and as long as that Maia was still in power nobody could defeat Doriath. 

Lindon did not fight against Sauron for thousands of years!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Why is Lindon even there in number 2?!!!!! Lindon was almost destroyed by Sauron just in less than two years of battle. If it wasn't for Numenor arriving in time, Lindon would have been destroyed. Lindon only fought against Sauron in actual battles for less than 20 years. Let me calculate... Fron 1700 until 1701 that's two years + Dagorlad (2 years?) + seven years of Siege of Barad-dur. 

Lorien is so underrated.

Lorien literally saved Middle-earth by saving the survivors of Eregion: ""He would indeed have been overwhelmed had not Sauron’s host
been attacked in the rear; for Durin sent out a force of Dwarves from
Khazad-dûm, and with them came Elves of Lórinand led by Amroth."" - Unfinished Tales 

Lorien also fought in the Last Alliance.

Ever since Dol Guldur was established in 1050 TA Lorien had withstood against many threats. And still more after the Disaster of Moria in 1980 TA. 

Unlike the movie version, surely the White Council did not attack Dol Guldur without an army. The nearest army available was Lorien's. 

Then, there's this: 

""These two kinsfolk (Fëanor and Galadriel), the greatest of the Eldar in Valinor, were unfriends for ever."" ""Who together with the greatest of all the Eldar, Luthien Tinuviel, daughter of Elu Thingol, are the chief matter of the legends and histories of the Elves.""

(The Peoples of Middle-earth, ""The Shibboleth of Fëanor"")

Eorl, UT: 'and none can pass, few or many, through the Dwimordene where dwells the White Lady and weaves nets that no mortal can pass.' 

""Three times Lórien had been assailed from Dol Guldur, but besides the valour of the elven people of that land, the power that dwelt there was too great for any to overcome, unless Sauron had come there himself. Though grievous harm was done to the fair woods on the borders, the assaults were driven back; and when the Shadow passed, Celeborn came forth and led the host of Lórien over Anduin in many boats. They took Dol Guldur, and Galadriel threw down its walls and laid bare its pits, and the forest was cleansed.""

Seems like she is","that does not make sense for what they are doing with this show a ton of things happen in between events many characters would die during the course of the story you cant just make shit up and condense k years of lore into a time period where everyone will still be alive just because you want to have certain characters be more or less important while telling a story like this 

in point of fact you can do that but it would just be difficult to do well though i havent seen anything that says theyre compressing significant amount of nd age history into a few years 

the sheer hubris and foolishness of them attempting this is absurd

you seem like a very    impassioned person a little too muc perhaps 

as far as i am aware

hm almost like the series isnt out yet apart from forging the rings what do you think theyre putting in thats out of place the forging of the rings takes place about halfway through the nd age 

oh fuck off with that bullshit oldest dismissive argument ever and you people do that every time someone has a problem with a shit adaptation you just want it exactly like the books no i dont i want it to be faithful to the story that was written and i want it done well 

we litterally all want it done well and to be plenty inspired from the source materials but they litterally choose this period since it allowed them to original stories in the material like it or not this is going to be little different than the other lotr inspired stuff we already have

they are changing the core pillars of the story and characters for no reason and they clearly dont even understand or care about the themes and concepts of the story anywa

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Episode 5 where Mando getting exiled and getting his ship seemed like it was plopped in from a S3 Mandalorian storyboard, but it was well-executed, and actually furthered the plot as whole. I don't think they could dropped Din Djarin into Boba Fett season without it, and frankly it was my FAVORITE episode.

Episode 6 or ""Episode of Grogu"" as I call it, completely unnecessary and I wish it was just in S3 Mando. It was cool to see Luke CGI has advanced even more since we last saw him, but why did that whole bit need to be *here,* why not just in next season of Mando? Also, just having Ahsoka there means we've been robbed of seeing Ahsoka meeting Luke for the first time, and that thought makes me U P S E T. Finally, why oh why did they feel the need to make Grogu come back to Din in episode 7? Because they needed a way to tie Peli into that final battle, Avengers style?? I don't buy it, it felt forced. Especially would've loved to see Din traveling to Mandalore solo to find his destiny, and be met with Grogu later. I digress.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The whole season of Boba Fett I was curiously enjoying the little tusken tribe flashbacks, but then flash back to present and Boba is just... a good... guy? Since when? Young Boba in CW had a sense of honor, sure, but this dude still was a bad mamba-jamba. *That's literally the point.* He's supposed to be FEARED, intimidating, DANGEROUS. He's supposed to be like version of Cad Bane with a better sense of honor (due to his mandalorian heritage and upbringing). 

So times like: the mayor's assistant giving him lip, and then the second time being a smartass about the ""mayor's schedule,"" real Boba would've fried that little cretin right then and there. We got a glimpse of the real Boba in Mando S2 vs the stormtroopers - that was awesome, the badass with the body language displaying martial confidence beyond what any of our other characters display, coupled with insanely powerful little gadgets and weaponry. (Also LOL @ Fennec and Boba breaking into the palace and him saying ""there's an advantage to people thinking you're dead,"" immediately grabs little rabbit-droid ""DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM, IM BOBA FETT!""

There's a dichotomy between Din and Boba that I enjoy, but I wish they'd lean into way more; Din is the hero, a hunter with a heart of gold, Boba is the anti-hero, near-villain hunter whose only inhibition is a strange code of honor.

But instead we got... Din and Din-lite, as Boba wants to... clean up the town? He claimed he wanted to be a crime lord, but then just straight up wants to kick out the spice trade, without trying to find a way to be a part of it? He seemed like he wanted to be Cobb Vanth on a bigger scale if you ask me. [Since you didn't ask me, the ending + mid credit scene indicates to me Boba will help Din with Mandalorian problems and find his ""tribe,"" and a recovered/cyborg'd Cobb Vanth will act as a Sheriff-like Daimyo - that's all my guess at least].
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Cad Bane... man so many complaints about Cad Bane. I agree, they could've made him look more like he should from Clone Wars/Bad Batch, and maybe edited his voice to have that smooth robotic backdrop instead of just being low and growly. But I can live with how they handled the conversion to live action - it just could've been better.

Idk i felt pretty disappointed with their final showdown though. All the buildup, for YEARS, of their inevitable cowboy throwdown, and it lead to that? The standoff with Cobb Vanth+Deputy was handled better IMO. Bane is a SW version of The Man in Black (westworld), The Bad (Good, Bad, the Ugly), he's straight up a space cowboy. So you gotta cinematically almost make a tribute standoff like in classic Spaghetti Western films! Tension, that's the word I've been looking for. That standoff needed tension, which we got with Bane vs Vanth.

I like that they tried to have a dialogue between the two, and give some background to casual audience who don't really know Bane that well, but it sort of felt *empty* to me. Might just be me being real picky. They didn't even mention ""last time we did this"" or something to reference the unproduced episode of CW that has all but been confirmed canon. Ugh. I just craved more, and would've been a perfect time to build that much desired tension.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Finally, the cherry on top, Fennec Shand. Fenn-exposition was already pointed out on this thread, and boy there's no better way to put it. How come Boba is the crime boss but Fennec is smarter, deadlier, more strategic, and way more tactful? Who is the real boss here, and why isn't it Fennec? It's like her only purpose in the season has been to explain things and then deus ex assassinate/capture some people for Boba because frankly she's been shown to be better than he is. The worst part of all though is how wasted of an opportunity she is, ANY development for her character would've been received with arms wide open, but instead she's just kinda *there.* It's doubly a shame because Ming-Na Wen does suuuuch a good job. It just feels like Kylo Ren all over again: interesting character, AMAZING actor, TERRIBLE writing and corner-cutting plot points, minimal development.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It's just annoying to me that the best episode was basically the S3 premier of Mandalorian - Din Djarin being exiled and learning more about the Darksaber is the strongest intrigue and cool-factor they've got going right now and man did it show. 

[Also a sidenote: I wonder how the N1 starfighter got to Tatooine? I'm guessing we'll find out in Kenobi, because surely he fights Vader, where he'll learn ""He's more machine now than man. Twisted and evil,"" and there's no way Vader fights him on Tatooine because then he'd surely find out about Luke (also Vader wouldn't set foot on that coarse, rough, irritating planet lol). Maybe we'll see them clash on Naboo?]

So overall I gotta give this season of Boba a 5/10, and most of that is carried by Din Djarin and Fenn-exposition. It's weird, I just don't care to know more about Boba's story after this, frankly I am just invested in Din Djarin and the Darksaber now.

I saw episode 7 twice and the other two once and have bought zero merchandise and will continue to spend nothing on SW because of how disappointed I am.  If the films were good, I would have seen each several times, would have bought them on iTunes/whatever, would have bought toys, etc.  So, while profitable, I think Disney actually messed up and left a ton of money on the table.

I think this is all short term greed.  Sure, they’ll make a buck and they know fans will watch regardless- but that only works for so long.  Eventually the fans will abandon the franchise without Disney having brought in anyone new.

He hardly steps in to help them except the minimum required to seem to fulfill his contract. He misinforms the Syndicate about Freetown, and it's only through his actions that they help out in the end. When Mando and Boba face off against the forces building outside of sanctuary, he could have remained there and been a force multiplier that could have finished them off before their reinforcements arrive, but he waited until the Syndicate's forces and androids had been finished off instead, when there's the greatest risk to him, to face Boba Fett.

I think that Cad Bane's real objective is Boba Fett, and understanding why he has become who he has become. I'm going out on a limb on this theory, but I think there's a chance Cad Bane realizes he's getting old, and he's probably amassed an untold fortune from his bounties, but he just doesn't know how to do anything else with it except bounty hunting. The Syndicate job could have gone two ways, depending on what he discovered about what he didn't know: why Boba Fett changed. He could have provided his full aid to the Syndicate and Boba Fett would have had no chance. Or, he could decide to finally retire. To finally say his goodbyes and his final lessons in his own way, faking his death along the way to avoid all the notoriety that would have prevented his retirement.

- I was hoping he’d remain connected to the Tuskans but they were wiped out. 
- I was hoping we’d see more of Fett actually learning how to connect with the Rancor but I guess they’d rather show more Mandalorian, even though he has his own show, and just use the rancor as a cheap Deus Ex.

9190,1,"/r/StarWars",0,"* A solid if not somewhat underwhelming finale given who the main character is. The Rancor scenes really elevated this episode. Without them...
* So at a certain point Din drops the Darksaber after using it on and then falling from the giant droid and doesn't pick it up before he runs off. I'm going to take it that was an oversight and he has it with him now. 
* Maybe I'm wrong but it felt like that Boba vs Bane fight wouldn't have been more exciting and active had it been in a movie or animated. All said and done it was quite bland. I found it odd for Boba to be reaching for his rifle and such after getting shot and laying on the ground given he still had his hand blaster in his holster. 
* The CW Cyberpunk 2077 kids are still a joke. Don't get me wrong, they are very Filoni and even Lucas, but they are the kiddy and overly campy aspect I have never enjoyed about Star Wars. 
* That mid-credits scene is really weird. Don't get me wrong, I expected him to live by why tease it like that? It makes you assume something will come of that. I would assume he's the perfect guy to be the street walking, handshaking, face of Boba's government like Boba was saying they needed while the people were saluting him but how does that warrant that mid-credit tease? 

The series as a whole was really average, in fact disappointing given who the main character is. I'm not one of those people who needed him to pick up where he left off and be a low-word-count hyper badass deadliest bounty hunter like some other people who can't get over him not being how they imagined when they played with his action figures. I'd be more open to that if we didn't already have Din who is exactly what Boba was. 

The show really survived on three things, the Mando season 2.5 bits, the flashbacks and the Rancor in the finale. I'm pretty shocked how weak their story was for Boba Fett's own show. Hell, they effectively only had Boba's story in 5.5 episodes out of 7 and still nearly half of it was walk and talks and boring politics. 

I'll be honest, after this season and where Boba and Mos Espa is at, I'm good with there being no season 2. I'm sand planet-ed out, Boba can only do so much in the sandbox that is Tatooine/Mos Espa and he needs to talk less which for a show like was set up like it was, doesn't really work. 

Lastly, no, there was no problems with nostalgia or fan service. Anyone who thinks that doesn't seem to understand this is just another Filoni show, directly tied to all his others, where in places that it makes sense you see Leia, Obi Wan, Qui Gon, Yoda, Lando, Boba, Tarkin and Vader. Grogu is a force sensitive (former Jedi padawan it seems?) and he calls out to the force for a teacher... guess who is literally the only Jedi teacher in the galaxy at that point in time? And guess what he's doing? Yup, it's Luke and he's building his Academy. It lines up perfectly. Cad Bane showing up... why wouldn't the Pike's hire the #1 bounty hunter in the galaxy and the only person to have beaten Boba Fett when they're going up against Boba Fett? I mean FFS people, stop throwing around ""nostalgia"" and ""fan service"" so much. You clearly don't know what they mean or when they actually apply. Imagine this show is animated and you will see this is all 100% classic Filoni, lining up perfectly with what he's done in the past. He knows when to and how to use characters and stories from the OT, PT, comics, legends and now ST in order to make Star Wars feel like it's all connected. All while almost always doing it in a way that makes total sense, isn't forced and doesn't make the universe feel too small.","a solid if not somewhat underwhelming finale given who the main character is the rancor scenes really elevated this episode without them

did you really expect a show produced by one of the largest employers in the states to buck the social trend and just have an all white cast this doesnt need to be focused on the cast has been casted lets see how well they act

in a market where the general goal has become to be the next got despite said shows massive failures in the final seasons

you really think theyre striving for a terrible ending when this is said lmao got was the zeitgeist until the final season i forget too sometimes with how badly it wrapped up kinda just blocked it out after the finale

lol im just saying to take it for what it is lets wait to see whether or not they entirely bastardize the stories theyre telling before focusing this much negative energy im actually glad they mentioned theyre skewing timelines etc as it lets us put it in its own context ahead of time would i prefer a faithful adaptation of course what am i gonna do about it at this point write an angry letter

14419,1,"/r/StarWars",0,"Okay a decent ending to a pretty interesting series, some highs and lows but overall I had an enjoyable time. On just the nostalgia/re introduction of old characters factor alone I am thankful for Book of Boba but there are some issues that kinda drag the whole experience down. Felt really poorly paced and nothing really happened until the finale, the characters were pretty bland, and I gotta be honest there was A LOT of cringe. It started off strong where I was really engaged in the beginning seeing the flashbacks of his time with the raiders and his re introduction into the cities underworld/mafia life, but man did it just grind to a halt in the middle. I get you have to establish other players but Boba didn’t even do anything for so many episodes, he felt like a side character in his own show. The sudden shift to legit two Mandolorian episodes didn’t help that at all and while I really liked the Luke/Grogu and Mando plots, it’s the Book of BOBA FETT come on lol. Probably the worst scene in the entire series was the Mod’s bike “chase” (and I use chase very lightly here it visually looked so awkward), and a lot of the fights were not well choreographed. 

Some of the best parts of the series for me were the Tuscan flashbacks with that train heist being *chefs kiss* along with bringing back the homie Cad Bane what a legend. The syndicate was a bland generic bad guy group and Boba kinda just lucked into a lot of his allies… super nice of the Hutts to just dispose of their badass wookie in front of Boba so he can get a life debt, also the way that wookie attacked was terrible dude had Boba dead to eights in the tank and then whipped out BRASS KNUCKLES?? The mods were just a sitting group of youth street bikers for him to be like “Eyyy y’all want some work” and then Mando happened to be available and able to get the people of Freetown. It all just felt very unearned. The Rankor was awesome tho great addition, tho I cannot believe how long that last fight went between the good guys vs those droids and HELLA syndicate enemies. That one mod did a spin move and still had time to shoot I was laughing my ass off at how ridiculous it was, nobody died except the Gamorian Guards RIP the loyal homies. I did like the development of Boba as a character I have no complaints of who is trying to be as a leader and a more mature person in the universe, just wish he kinda did more.

20343,1,"/r/StarWars",0,"It also works for how Rey's story had been set up.

""No, Luke. I am your father."" is so engrained in pop culture that I think people overlook why having his father turn out to be the villain works for Luke in a way it doesn't for a lot of other characters the evil dad trope is just slapped onto. Luke and the audience are consistently told that he's a lot like his father, and given the great hero Obi-Wan leads him to believe Anakin was, being like his father is something that Luke sees as a good thing. To find out that his father is Darth Vader, and that he actually was that great hero before but still turned to the dark side, is a major blow to Luke. Now it's potentially a very bad thing that he's so much like his father and makes him question his own ability to resist the dark side.

Rey, by contrast, was always alone, and feeding herself and the audience the belief that her parents will someday come back and that they must have left her behind on Jakku for a reason. The mystery around her sets her up as someone coming from something special, or at the very least that she's someone who wants to be, who wants to feel that they have some place in everything. To be forced to confront that her parents were simply nobodies who sold her off is a major blow to her, because now she feels truly alone and that there is no place for her anywhere, which makes Kylo's offer of friendship and destroying the painful past actually somewhat tempting.

Having an evil relative works for Luke in a way it doesn't for Rey or at lot of other characters without similar set-up, because there is no emotional weight or thematic importance to it. There's no reason in Rey's story to care that Palpatine is her grandfather other than the script says she does.

I've been thinking a lot about this just because I'm part of the My Hero Academia fandom and there's a lot of people there who think the protagonist Midoriya is going to turn out to be the son of the big villain All For One...pretty much only because it's known that the author loves Star Wars.

I think a good model for connected TV shows are the Marvel TV shows. Each TV show like Hawkeye, Loki, Wandavision, etc are connected.

We don't see an entire episode of Hawkeye suddenly focus on Yelena for two entire episodes, yet in the Book we abruptly shift to the Mandalorian's POV, we abruptly jump to Luke teaching Grogu. We're effectively progressing the story of Mando and Grogu **at the expense** of Boba's story.

we dont see an entire episode of hawkeye suddenly focus on yelena for two entire episodes yet in the book we abruptly shift to the mandalorians pov we abruptly jump to luke teaching grogu were effectively progressing the story of mando and grogu at the expense of bobas story

11785,1,"/r/StarWars",0,"A “War” that consisted of 20 people running slowly and hiding behind a wall?  

I am one who tries to hold my criticism of Star Wars to a minimum. Being a person who was all of 3 or 4 when the original came out, I’ve grown with this galaxy over the years. So I’ve told myself I’m not going to be critical of a series that is generally for kids. I try to just enjoy them. 

But dear Lord, Rodriguez has just really not done it for me. I got my 12” Boba Fett figure when I was 4. And I loved that toy. And I’ve loved the mystique of this character. I loved the Tusken story. I loved the background building up his change of heart. But all that took place on Tatooine after he took over Jabba’s reign?  I just don’t get any of it? Crime Lord? There could have been a better story there. 

I was hoping Book of Boba Fett could have been a great non-linear story of his time before the Sarlaac pit. An anthology of some of his adventures from his bounty hunting days. Mask on. Lol. Although I do enjoy Morrison. I’d love to see him play Rex or others. 

I can’t imagine how hard these productions are to put together. So many moving parts. My hat’s off to the actors and everyone working on it. But my goodness Rodriguez’s direction and shooting and lighting and angles. It just made it feel slow, clunky, and cheap. These broad daylight shots of the streets with barely anyone on them. Like I said before. This war seemed like 30-40 kids got together and were playing pretend with some awesome Star Wars stuff. 

There were some fun parts here. I really hate sounding like a nay-sayer. I just feel bummed on a whole, especially by the Rodriguez stuff. Give Bryce Dallas Howard more episodes in the future. 

Looking forward to Mando season 3. I loved season two so much more than season one. So maybe there will be some redemption and retooling if there’s a Book of Boba season two. Fingers crossed. Such a fun universe to play with.","a war that consisted of  people running slowly and hiding behind a wall

I think the black dwarf and black elf etc are much bigger problems and going more strongly against the spirit of Tolkiens work and is pretty inexcusable.

If you isolate each thing people have a problem with, it's not like it's catastrophic in itself, but a lot of smaller things added together can become a big problem.

- Peli shoots the Twi'Lek's cover and just tells him to get behind her for what reason? ""Get behind me, pretty face. Peli's got you covered"" Whyyyy are they writing these cringe lines in the heat of battle my god.

1842,1,"/r/StarWars",0,"Okay. I'll try not to make a big post about nothing, but I just have to get this off my chest.

Firstly, I'm so grateful to have had such a fun show that happened to feature my favorite Star Wars character, that being Cad Bane. He's been a real treat to see and only made a good show greater.

That being said, I'm a little bummed at the potential ending he got. It's thematic, it's fitting, it's poetry (it rhymes!), but also feels like wasted opportunity. Bane is the perfect foil to Boba - a skilled Bounty Hunter who actively chooses and thrives in the role. Unlike Boba, who actively wants to better himself and others, Bane wants only to survive and get paid. Similarly, he's a dark mirror at Boba and his past life. Every time he looks Cad Bane's red eyes, he sees all the pain of his past life and the road it led him down. Bane is the perfect example of an antagonist - someone who challenges and changes their protagonist. And while I'm not saying Cad Bane needs to be the main villain (as much as I'd personally like that), he would make a wonderful addition to the Rogue's Gallery that challenges Boba on his journey. What's more, now he has further beef and wonderful plot opportunities with Boba, Fennec Shand, and Cobb Vanth! Tell me you don't want to see a final rematch between Cad and Cobb. 

Now, I know I'm just belly aching. I should just be happy that I got to see Cad Bane one more time. But I feel like Filoni knew there would be people like me out there, hence that beeping noise in his ""death scene."" He's leaving that door open for more, just in case. And to those who say I'm in denial or just hopeful, I would like to remind you that we all just watched a show about a Bounty Hunter that got eaten by the Sarlacc Pit and was assumed dead for over 20 years! Furthermore, there have been so many characters that people liked so much that even though they were clearly on death's door (Looking at you, Fennec Shand... Darth Maul... Ahsoka... PALPATINE), we got to see so much more of them in future material. 

As the jedi once said... ""no one's ever really gone.""

So...I'm sad, but I'm happy to have had what I got and am hopeful for more. And I want everyone working on Star Wars to know it. And I call on all of you who feel like me to do the same. Talk actively about how much you want to see Cad Bane again. Talk about what you want from the future and how he'd fit into it. Talk about how thrilled you were to see him in live action. And definitely buy any Merch with him in it.

If you liked seeing him as much as I did, tell everyone. And hopefully Favreau and Filoni will continue to give the fans a bit of what they want.

I hope.","okay ill try not to make a big post about nothing but i just have to get this off my chest

There are times that some things don't matter or at least don't matter as much, it all depends. There wouldn't be as much backlash, if diversity was among humans, you can give it valid explanation lore wise. For both dwarves and elves, however, people grew to expect very specific looks. And that expectation has been solidified by multitude of other media, not just lotr. 

You yourself care about appearances too, you may have made an exception about skin tone but it will not apply to other things. Would you care if dwarves were portrayed as tall as humans?

there are times that some things dont matter or at least dont matter as much it all depends there wouldnt be as much backlash if diversity was among humans you can give it valid explanation lore wise for both dwarves and elves however people grew to expect very specific looks and that expectation has been solidified by multitude of other media not just lotr 

you yourself care about appearances too you may have made an exception about skin tone but it will not apply to other things would you care if dwarves were portrayed as tall as humans would you care if there were ugly elves or elves whos ears are not pointy would you care if galadriels hair would be black would you care if aragorn had a mohawk hair cut there are many seemingly superficial things that can put people off its just how it is and same people never care when it is a fresh material with no expectations for appearances prior to that"

Tatooine? Nothing. It's a dirt planet full of crime. Boba Fett being the jolly mayor of one city - not even the most well-known one - isn't exactly changing that.

Boba Fett? I think he's kind of a washed-up loser who only succeeded because a bunch of cool people felt sorry for him and/or owed a favor to other cool people. 

Disney Star Wars? They are extremely capable of having amazing sets full of CW-level effects. Good God, throw a *little* dosh at your TV properties instead of just letting them play pretend around the same two streets in Tatooine.

37270,1,"/r/lotr",1,"On Elrond’s clothes:

I have two points. First, imagine how absolutely immersion destroying it would be to have a relatively young traveling messenger in an unknown outdoor context look or dress the same as the last Great Loremaster of Elvendom in Middle earth does during the most important diplomatic summit in three thousand years. 

The expectation that they would look anything alike in their dress, mannerism, or demeanor is absurd. 

Second, pay close attention to the adjectives this guy uses to describe young Elrond’s clothes. “Boring”. “Soulless”. Subjective words which have no innate meaning other than the feelings of the speaker. You can’t measure those. 

Another person would look at those clothes and say “practical traveling clothes” or perhaps “interestingly simplistic” and begin to wonder about what the context for an elf in such attire might be. I don’t know, perhaps traveling a long way while carrying secret military communication to which he didn’t want to draw attention? Since, you know, that was literally his job at that point in his life. 

About his armor in the Jackson clip, it’s incorrect to say that there is a “distinct elven style”. The elves are sundered people who’s languages and art have diverged from one another. I think it would be best to say that you can see perhaps a distinct Sindarin style, which makes use of plant-like motifs, lots of greens and browns, etc. the Noldor would have had a completely different style. Speaking of which….

On Galadriel’s armor:

I leave aside the criticisms about the practicality of the armor type (overplated, too much loose mail) since those aren’t really about the story but about Hollywood’s poor understanding of armor in general. 

But I will talk about whether it is mannish or elvish. 

Boromir is the heir to the stewardship of a kingdom descended from Numenor. The Numenor which learned great skill of craft and art from the elves and *especially* from the Noldor. It would be perfectly reasonable to assume that the Kings of Numenor probably wore Elven armor that was given to them as gifts in order to show their mighty status and great friendship with the elves…… until the deceit of Sauron turned the hearts of the kings away from the Eldar. 

Then the House of Elendil remained close to the elves, and when Numenor fell and Elendil, Anarion, and Isildur became kings in Middle Earth…… why wouldn’t they craft their armor after the manner of ancestors and their elven friends? 

So no, Galadriel’s armor doesn’t look Mannish. Boromir’s armor, as well as the Gondorian aesthetic in general, *look Noldorin* in imitation of their fathers. 

And lastly, the dwarf. 

My thoughts are a lot like what I said about Elrond. In what world is it reasonable to expect  a civilian dwarf from one tribe in Moria in an unknown context to dress like a battle-clad dwarven warrior from theBlue Mountains and the  Lonely Mountain three thousand years later? It wouldn’t be reasonable to expect their expressive motifs to be the same at all. 

And like Elrond, I call bullshit about the “potato sack” comment. We can’t tell the quality of that by looking at it, and we don’t know the context. It could very well BE a potato sack….. in the middle of a religious ritual which requires such a garb. OR….. that could feel softer than silk and be the most sought after textile this side of Rhun. 

We don’t know. 

In conclusion, the whole argument is basically “it doesn’t glitter, therefore it’s not gold” and I think you all need to go back to Bolbo’s hearth and listen to what he’s got to say on the subject of gold and glitter and whatnot.","on elronds clothes

How I would personal do it is that in TFA there is a janitor who says cryptic things in the First Order Starkiller Base; first glance it's just a cameo from McDiarmid and being a janitor most people just ignore him and Kylo thinks he's a spy for Snoke. Hux would however put some advise from this janitor to use as the Resistance is attacking Starkiller Base and increase the use of Tie Fighters to harass the X-wing assault and initially repel it; just as it seems Poe is about to die, another older x-wing appears and takes out Poe's five pursuers, with the reveal that it's Luke with R2D2. Luke gives only a cursory communication to the Resistance and First Order (which causes jubilation in the Resistance and horrified shock in the First Order) before ejected from the X-Wing (letting R2D2 to land it near the Falcon) and sneaking into their base on foot.

Luke  eventually he finds the Snoke comms room and the Janitor is there; before Luke can confront him Captain Phasma (who would not have been thrown down the trash) and an elite team of Storm Troopers attempt to ambush Luke; Phasma announces she is broadcasting this live and will now execute the Jedi Master; Her squad gets two volleys in - however Luke repeats Kylo's trick from earlier stopping the bolts; redirecting the first wave at the Janitor (obviously a clone of Palpatine) and sending the second set of shots back at the blasters, effectively disarming the stormtroopers. Rey would burst into the room at this moment, sensing the shift in the Force caused by the clone's death. Rey is amazed that Luke is there but he basically ignores her as he berates Snoke for being a puppet, finishing the Storm Trooper squad and making sure that the clone is actually dead (something Rey can do automatically because she hasn't been slowly corrupted by the dark side like Luke has been by killing all these Palpatine clones by himself). Luke is so distracted that he misses Rey being guided by the Force to take his lightsaber and run off to find Kylo Ren and join the fight between him and Finn. 

That duel is more weighted to Kylo due to his experience and Finn and Rey actively getting in each other's ways by accident; to this point Kylo nearly wins the duel before Luke shows up and uses the Force to shove Kylo into a tree, knocking him unconscious before taking the three lightsabers using the force and walking back to the X-Wing. Finn and Rey decide to follow Luke with the Millenium Falcon; picking up Kylo Ren due to Rey getting a feeling from the Force that she should; leading to a sequel with Finn, Rey, Chewbacca, BB-8 and a reluctant Kylo searching for Luke and trying to figure out what is wrong with him while Poe is sent to tail them and get Luke back on the Republic/Resistance's side.","yeah if palpatine was the end game he should have appeared in tfa in some shape or form it could have been used to explain what happened to luke  lukes been chasing palpatine across the galaxy try to stop his clones and plots and didnt have time to train many students  an palpatine corrupted a few kylo ren further shifting the balance of the force to the dark side heck it could explain why rey is so powerful  like anakin she came into existence to help rebalance the force and push luke back to training up new jedi

9479,1,"/r/StarWars",0,"""Boba Fett becomes a crime lord"" sounds like an awesome premise, but it was the weakest part of a show about Boba Fett becoming a crime lord. 

""Boba joins the Tusken Raiders"" was interesting, at the very least, with a bit of world building and backstory. The ""Mandalorian season 3 sneak peak"" was really good if a bit rushed due to being shoehorned in. ""Boba fights endless waves of syndicate goons with his friends and rides a rancor"" was a fun finale, even with some unintentionally hilarious moments in the battles. 

Meanwhile, the ""Boba Fett becomes a crime lord"" plot starts with him declaring himself a crime lord based on respect and ends with him mildly annoyed about being a crime lord (and feeling like he's not right for the job) with no real examination of why he wanted to become a crime lord in the first place. It almost felt like his arc was written backwards. 

If you flip it, after Boba kills Bib Fortuna (wants a castle, needs a bacta tank, just because), Boba reluctantly starts doing crime lord things to fix the problems caused by the power vacuum he made (Tusken Raider flashbacks informing why he wants to help someone in need), builds some temporary alliances, fights the Pykes, ends up as the crime lord of Tatooine because everyone respects him (and his rancor).

Breed, as a noun, has three meanings in English:

1. A group of related animals or plants with similar genotypes and phenotypes, usually in the context of domestication where the group is produced and maintained deliberately by selective breeding for those qualities.
2. Any race or lineage of a thing 
3. A group of people with shared characteristics without any sense of genetic relation to one another: eg. 'Honest politicians are a dying breed'. 

Some dictionaries fold two and three into one another nowadays. With eugenics and genaology being rather out of fashion, we don't tend to speak of 'breeds' of people in quite the sense 2. means anymore.

Literally none of these definitions match up to Tolkein's use of the word 'race' where he uses it roughly to mean 'species'.

For instance, elves and men can have fertile children. Nonetheless, the differences between these groups is much bigger than the difference implied by the term 'breed' in typical usage.

3935,1,"/r/StarWars",0,"> Luke doesn't really have any attachments to Vader other than ""we're related"". 

And? That’s an attachment.

> Yoda only says he needs to confront Vader, Obi-Wan says he needs to kill him, but only because he thinks he's beyond saving. Luke has faith that there's another way. Yoda specifically tells Luke not to use his abilities for attack, but for defense.

Like a lot of people you’re making the mistake of taking Yoda very literally. Yoda tells Luke point blank he must confront Vader in order to become a Jedi. Yoda’s lesson was that Jedi should never *initiate conflict* not that they can never fight offensively. He’s saying “You use what I’m teaching you to help people not go around starting shit”.

> And it's all tested. As soon as the Emperor and Vader threaten his real attachments - his friends and Leia - he strikes in anger. Exactly what the Emperor wants. Luke doesn't stop because he loves his dad he never knew, he stops because he sees himself becoming like Vader. He cut off Vader's hand just like Vader did to him. It's a grim reminder of his failure in the cave. So he stops using his abilities for attack. Not just on Vader, but the Emperor, too.

Yeah…no. Another person on this “Jedi are pacifists” bullshit. Luke stops attacking Vader because, if he gives in to his emotions and kills Vader then he *becomes* Vader. It’s what the Emperor wanted. In refusing, he does what Anakin could not and rejects Palpatine’s seduction and becomes a true Jedi.

Luke then naively thinks he’s won. I’m positive he wouldn’t have tossed his lightsaber away if he knew Sheev had lightning fingers.

Jedi are knights. They fight. It comes with the job.

> At worst it's very easy to see how Luke could mistakenly take this attachment lesson from Ahsoka as a truth. At best, it's a pretty correct lesson.

Err…no? Luke’s attachment to Vader directly leads to Vader’s redemption and that saved both Luke and the galaxy. No matter how you try to bend it, Luke’s attachment allowed him to prevail in the end. Period.

It’s normal and healthy to have attachments. People like to say it was Anakin’s attachments that lead to the downfall of everything but that’s an oversimplification. It was Anakin’s attachments being explicitly forbidden and the people he loved being in mortal danger that drew him to the Dark Side as well as his unwillingness to compromise. He could’ve left the Order but he wanted to have his cake and eat it.

Luke doesn’t have to hide or feel ashamed of his attachments and having them is why the Rebellion wins.

Did trying to protect his loved ones tempt him to the Dark Side? Yeah. But Luke knows continuing on that path will turn him into Vader. Luke proves you can have attachments, they can be a strength, and you can still reject the Dark Side.","luke doesnt really have any attachments to vader other than were related

22306,1,"/r/StarWars",0,"Yes it's just you... 

I mean seriously, this answer doesn't make sense at all. If you ask a yes/no question and one of the answer possibilities is bullshit, then your question is not a question but a statement.

Why put your statements like that? I know you're not the only one and maybe you even couldn't answer that because you just do what many do... Those Is-it-just-me-or statements .. isn't this just some method to call people that think the same way you do?

If you put your statement in a way like: I think we deserve a better Boba Fett show. Then this is open for debate. One can agree or disagree, both possibilities are adequate (from a perspective of how language works. Here the point is: what possibilities to react does the form of a statement allow).

If you say: is it just me or do we deserve... Then the generic answer is agreement (in the form of a disagreement, that's ironic haha). The only logic answer is: no it is not just you, we are a group and we all agree. (Logic based on what the form of your statement allows for possibilities to reply).

I disagree, you don't deserve a better Boba Fett show. Ha! But the form of your statement does not give me the possibility to express that as a fitting reply. 


So this Is-it-just-me-or way of stating something closes the topic. It's a call for agreement, that then is given in the form of disagreement. That's interesting because this way you take away the possibility to really disagree. The disagreement option is already occupied by agreeing to you haha. That's a really smart mechanism.
As I said. Disagreeing to you (in a form that replies to your statement fittingly) would need me to state no, it's just you. And that is obviously not the case. Whatever you state after Is-it-just-me-or you will find people who agree with high probability. I see those kind of posts a lot and it is never followed by an unusual or really individual statement. 
People who are disagreeing are forced to (sorry, not by you personally, but by the logical form of your statement and the lack of options to disagree) break the flow of conversation (I am sorry, I cannot find a better way to put that). You have to reply in an inadequate way... Ok never mind, I think I made my point.

43489,1,"/r/lotr",1,"Miles Morales had the same kind of backlash. I used to read Ultimate Spiderman at that time, and when Peter Parker died and Miles Morales was introduced there was the exact same sentiment as what's happening now.   


Miles Morales seems to be fine now, but that was not the case at first. Just google articles about it from 2011, not hard to find those time capsules.  


In my world, imagining my younger family members seeing black representation in Lord of the Rings is incredible. The fact that this community scoffs at a black elf because of some lore, while a lot of other lore is ignored bothers me.  


This show is is not 18+, and it is made to include 10-13 year olds. Having one black elf breaking the ""immersion"" of many people here is upsetting. I believe that the message of unity and gathering (I mean it's called The Fellowship of The Ring) is strong and relevant. Tolkien wrote the Hobbit in 1937 for christ's sake. We can't update it a little bit for the global village we now live in? Really? Most people here want to fall on a sword for only white elves?  


If you were to make a world war 2 film about Poland, and only show black actors, there's a problem. Middle-Earth is LITERALLY made up though. This ain't factual history. Liberties can be taken 80 years after fictional books are published.  


I also work in film and advertising, and I often work on very high-profile jobs. Representation is not always done right, but for example, The Dragon Prince does an amazing job of it.  


What is happening in this teaser is NOT The Dragon Prince. But the inclusion of one new character who has pointy ears, and is black should not have this much controversy. Let's not pretend that this isn't just a show based in a completely made up world. I believe adding a character of colour is a genuine move towards progress. If by a miracle this show becomes a hit, in 10 years time, many people will forget this backlash, like they did with Jackson's films, and Miles Morales.  


In my opinion, there should be much more backlash towards Galadriel wearing armour, and the awful CG. Let's not pretend that overwhelmingly in this reddit that is not the case.  


I understand it's not completely canon, but so many other things are breaking and bending and the overwhelming focus on the pigment of one actor as a cool elf is not appropriate. There are million other changes and adaptations going on here. Why is there so much focus on just this one here?  


For Tolkien and Catholicism there are actual papers and discussions. I found a quote regarding Jackson not focusing on the Tolkien's Catholic themes because he wasn't Catholic himself. I'm sure you can google that.  


For the scholar just google ""Mariana Rios Maldonado CFF Statement"" released one day ago.  ""We are saddened to see hate and abuse directed towards a person of colour researching Tolkien, and we stand by Mariana, her research, and her inclusive approach to fantasy. ""  


White elves really worth all this? From an adaptation of an 80 year old book in 2022? When there are a million other breaks and bends in the adaptations. People need to move off the topic. Having a black elf should be totally acceptable and does not break any over-arching story or world of Middle-Earth, just a detail, like many others.  


If the show fails, it's not because they cast Ismael Cruz Córdova, I can tell you that with certainty.","miles morales had the same kind of backlash i used to read ultimate spiderman at that time and when peter parker died and miles morales was introduced there was the exact same sentiment as whats happening now

I hear you, but do not agree with you. Peter Jackson for example, did not include many Catholic themes in his films. Don't remember there being an uproar there. Don't remember Tolkien Scholars getting death threats then.  


Adaptations are always ways to re-introduce stories to the current age we live in. To have darker-skinned heroic characters is not that far of a stretch, especially considering the global village the world has become, since 1937.  


I mean look at the video game Hades and the interpretations of Greek Gods there. Why wasn't there a backlash there? That game won almost every Game of the Year award. Imagine if people wrote it off the moment they showed character art?  


It is a given that this adaptation will take many liberties, but, the absolute freak out from this subreddit at a darker skinned elf at the forefront of all of these conversations is absolutely wild. I do not accept that that is what will make this show terrible.

-	How the heroes just stood in the open in the middle of the street the whole time

-	The heroes would just jog or act nonchalantly like they weren’t under fire or serious danger. Like when mando uses the dark saber on the weakens droid, he just kinda half jogs weirdly (maybe it’s just the dark saber being heavy idk)

-	Fighters not running. And just kept shooting the shields

-	Droids didn’t hit anything except the transport vehicle and rancor

-	How the droids couldn’t even break one of the little ledges on the buildings. Not sure, but they look like they are supposed to be artillery and “will destroy the city”

-	How the shield of the second battle droid just disappears after crashing into the house

-	How the droids were walking at a snails pace the whole time but could suddenly keep pace with the droid cart

-	How the mechanic lady was shooting her blaster at like a 45 degree angle like a mortar

-	Cad saying Boba’s name was weird. Like it sounded like Bobo or Balboa to me

-	They also kinda glossed over the Grogu + Mando reuinion

People are just angry. Sure maybe some of them let it get to their heads too much but I don't blame them. All they can see, myself included, is just another greedy cash grab where an awful team take a beloved, well known piece of work that already has a huge established presence, so they know that it will grab attention and views with minimal effort and they ruin it with their own stupid ideas - showing a lack of respect and care for the source material. Black Elves, Hobbits and Dwarves? That will probably be the least of the show's problems - and yes it is a stupid liberty taken by the studio and writers - and I'm of a mixed racial background. This isn't about racism or bigotry. It's about a total lack of respect or care whatsoever for the stories.
  

  
I don't give and F about having black or asian or any kind of different race being dwarfs Elves etc - why not? It's fine. Just write your own F'ing story where it's part of the original concept and do whatever you want with it. Just don't take a beloved series and ruin it with your own BS. Take Brandon Sanderson's ""Stormlight Archives"", for instance. Most of the characters and races in that world, Roshar, are dark-skinned with dark hair. Imagine if someone decided to adapt that and made them all white, or paler than they were obviously intended to be?
  

  
People wouldn't stand for it and I don't blame them. It's all just about money, greed, minimal effort and overinflated ego's of people who think that they are more skilled and talented than they really are.

First of all, I didn't say anything about cultures and how Tolkien influences culture. I don't know what argument you're trying to make here. But since we're going there, every generation since the first edition of LotR was published has been influenced by Tolkien's work. I'm not going to cite the hundreds of musicians and authors that have been influenced by Tolkien, of all cultures, races, and backgrounds.

I'm defending a piece of everyone's cultural heritage from a cynical capitalist machine that's trying to purely cash in on Tolkien's name.  And yes, I said everyone. Tolkien's work belongs to everyone and can be related to by anyone. These are cherished stories that many of us grew up with, and we care about how this world is treated. For the hard core English fans of Tolkien, it's very easy to see them taking Tolkien's original creation myth concept very seriously. Because that's what it was, and Tolkien took it seriously. He wasn't writing fanciful adventure books, he was writing real histories with complex characters and relationship. 

We are all aware that hobbits do not exist.

I think the thing that makes it all feel so off is how it all feels like I’m watching a play instead of a show.

It happens so often too, we’ll have person/group A awkwardly run off camera for person/group B to come into frame exactly how plays handle scene changes.  

It happened with Krrsantan, the Freetown people, the walker droids, the mods, the rancor and twice for Cad Bane.

13971,1,"/r/StarWars",0,"Hold my beer please…

1) Boba makes an informed decision to hold out at the Palace where all of their gear and vehicles are. He is then “persuaded” by two street dwellers to hold out inside a building that was recently bombed. Structural integrity alone makes this a bad idea. 

2) The Pyke Syndicate killed the Tusken tribe, not Cad like everyone thought. The reason Cad should have been that person will be brought up later. This is just a bad plot structure point for me. 

3) Luke sent Grogu and R2-D2 in his X-Wing back to Tatooine. Grogu was technically by himself. Seems slightly petty and irresponsible for a Jedi to get rid of a student with a toddler mentality. 

4) They split their personal reinforcements up in the wake of a war. Plus, sending Krrysantan to Trandoshians territory after he senselessly attacked and dismembered a group of Trandoshians is just a terrible idea. Right after Fennic says there will be no surprises because of this, Cad Bane is outside with sniper reinforcement. Good job!

5) The locals begin attacking their recon crews. This leads to the mod squad getting cornered, Krrysantan getting surrounded and dog piled by Mark Zuckerberg relatives, and the Gamorreans pushed off a cliff. First off, Krrysantan had a freaking blaster and gets beaten by a bunch of lizard people with swords. Also, the Gamorreans get little to no respect for their death even though they were a ride or die for Boba. They aren’t even mentioned following the teams victory. 

6) Fennics rescue of the Mod Squad was laughable. She posted up 5 feet above their location and then did a slow mo front flip to the ground before mounting her speeder. Also, her “Manners….I like it.” line was cringey. It was only missing a wink before speeding off. 

7) Mando and Bobas bro love moment was good. The two of them literally fighting in the open street vice taking cover or using their jet packs to flank or outmaneuver on the roof tops was bad in generally. Boys, you are putting too much trust in your Plot, I mean, Beskar Armor. 

8) Freetowns reinforcements roll up which consisted of 10 towns folk. 10 non-soldiers was the force decided to save Boba and his people against the Pykes. We had episodes of Tusken Tribes which probably ranges in the hundreds (maybe thousands) but Freetown is the designated saviors. 

9) Mod squad Vespa reinforcements was slow as always and stacked up in the SAME exact place as Boba, Mando, and the 10 Freetownians. The two mods that Boba took tactical advice pre-battle now joined in on a freaking killzone. Brilliant!

10) Let’s pump the brakes real quick. Krrysantan is going to join the killzone too after receiving an axe wound and SEVEN blaster shots to various body parts and armor. 

11) Out come the Heavy Assault Droids (Scorpenek Droids I think they were called). They look great, shields were great. Our band of misfit heroes shoot at the droids for FORTY FIVE SECONDS (I’m timing it). In this time, they can’t figure out they are wasting their time and neither droid takes a single shot (not that that will make a difference). 

12) Mando tries using the Dark Saber. This would have been awesome if he didn’t fail miserably followed by “I can’t get through.” No shit, boba witnessed you bro. Also, why are they having a conversation right next to these two “tanks” that are trying to kill them?

13) Boba flies away hopefully for something practical. Mando runs away instead of flying. Makes sense. 

14) The entire army runs in a giant line down a straight road with a giant killer droid behind them. Luckily, the only thing the droid can hit is the road. 

15) Krrysantan may have a moment of revelation as he thinks he can penetrate the barrier. Just kidding. He is kicked by the droid and then left alone as the droid leaves to pester the other denizens. Also, Krrysantan is magically healed of all wounds. 

16) Probably the most cringe moment of the series was Skad doing a 360 synchronize shot with Drash and Krrysantan. Who green lit that illegal spin. It’s not even a 360 no scope because his eye is a damn scope. 

17) Peli driving up in a rickshaw not knowing there is a battle going on is just lazy writing. Playing it off as her being deaf is even lazier. 

18) The misfits hold out at the Alamo which has plaster walls made of Beskar (probably). The droids blew up an armored vehicle for god sakes. The wall will hold though. 

19) THE BIGGEST DISSERVICE TO MANDALORIAN SEASON 3 Is the fact Mando and Grogu reunite in a fucking rickshaw with the 15 seconds of emotion and Mando telling him to sit his ass down so they can get blown up. A critical story point that should have been in Mando Season 3 is wasted on a subpar finale based on Boba. Thanks Disney. Also he chose the chainmail, sweet. /s

20) The only issue I have with the Rancor fight is the injury, or lack there of, sustained by the droids. This is obviously where the entire episode budget went because it looked fantastic. 

21) Grogus shining moment isn’t to implode the droid, but to remove joint piece from its leg and being shotgunned across the road from its impact. Thanks chainmail. 

22) Skad requires his robo eye to see the two on the roof 20 feet away. Drash proceeds to distract the Scorpenek droid right next to the person she is providing a distraction for. That is not how distractions work. And why did she need the cycler rifle for this? She is not doing any precision shooting. 

23) A minor CGI slip from the Rancors final kill. Droid went from 1 blaster to 2 blasters and back to 1 blaster. Not a deal breaker for me though. Shout out to the CGI artist. The droids and Rancor look phenomenal. 

24) Final droid barrier shooting time was 4:24 seconds. Learn quicker shooters. They are lucky the droids had a body count of ZERO. Who ever manufactured these pieces of shit war machine need to refund the Pykes. 

25) Boba survives fighting 2 kaiju fights on the rancor but Cad manages to knock him off with a wrist flame thrower. This also is enough to scare the rancor away. Riiiiiight. 

26) Cad Bane is one of the most renowned bounty hunters in the galaxy and they decided to give him maybe 5 minutes of total screen time before “killing” him off. There is no practical way Mando would have gotten the drop from his position to disarm Cad. I tried it in my living room with a broom. It’s not happening. And the last dying breath of Cad is auto tuned. Why did they do my boy like that. 

27) Rancor Kong scene was a little heavy handed. Mando jumps in and makes fool of himself again. Boba is no where to be seen to handle his pet he set loose, and Grogu ends up napping with it. Why didn’t Boba use Slave 1 to fight this battle again? 

28) Fennics assassination scene was the highlight for me. Lynching the mayor and killing the Pyke leader was badass. Why Fennec though? They killed Bobas tribe. This is Bobas “book” if you will. Why is Fennec killing off the revenge plot? Why isn’t Fennec the Daimyo?

29) Why does everyone respect Boba at the end after bringing a large scale battle to their city, setting a rancor loose to destroy a large section of their city, and causing a huge divide between the ruling houses?

30) The Wookiee still doesn’t get a medal. He gets a fucking melon. 

31) How did Cobb get to the Bacta tank so quickly. Why did he get the post credit scene over, let say, a crimson dawn homage for season 2, Cad Bane surviving, or something worth while. I think 95% of the people knew Cobb survived his blaster injury. We didn’t need his bacta scene. 

32) Why does Robert Rodriguez hate Star Wars?

Jokes aside, I appreciate that people liked this episode. I personally didn’t but that is besides the point. I am bitter about the lazy writing they provided the entire season and how it disservices such an iconic figure. Hopefully season 2 will learn from season 1 mistakes.

I wonder if they're setting Cobb Vanth up as the leader of Tatooine? Just going by the line at the end where they question '*if not them, who?*' - can't be showing him getting a sick and probably unnecessary body mod for no reason.

Overall, I enjoyed it enough. I think that the first few episodes were very disconnected. I really liked the Tusken stuff, but the Tatooine story sorta went nowhere until this episode, pretty much.

I think Lucasfilm should have been a little clearer from the get-go that this was going to be Mando 2.5. I've seen a lot of Lucasfilm peeps on Twitter saying it was always the plan, which makes sense, but at same time, the show is named The Book of *Boba Fett*. So, yah...

I also think that Mando S2 handled Boba better anyway, as he seemed much more capable in that show than he did his own.

It’s so weird because in mando we got moff mideon (a great bad guy) trying to steal grogu, so we felt the stakes. In this we’re meant to care about mos Vespa and the pykes running drugs? And in the end they just have a shoot out in the street and it’s all over. Just lazy and predictable.","yep couldnt agree more this whole show just felt rushed the pykes are cool looking aliens but they wrote them as pointless villains with no major back up plan or stakes i was really hoping to see the pykes hire a bunch of bounty hunters like cad bane bossk dengar etc and slowly introduce them episode by episode so we could see and feel the incoming danger its so weird because in mando we got moff mideon a great bad guy trying to steal grogu so we felt the stakes in this were meant to care about mos vespa and the pykes running drugs and in the end they just have a shoot out in the street and its all over just lazy and predictable"

9712,1,"/r/StarWars",0,"The episode was okay. But like everyone else pointed out, the shootout just wasn't good.

And the sense of scale was off. This was the pivotal fight to decide who will control Mos Espa. And both sides seemed small, only exasperated when Team Boba split up. Fennec Shan goes out of her way to say they could hire muscle in a previous episode. And then they don't do that. Sure, they hired Mando and Krrsantan, but was there seriously no one else to hire? Easy cannon fodder to spice up the ""war"".","the episode was okay but like everyone else pointed out the shootout just wasnt good

People who are saying that the name is being completely erased are also wrong. 

Lucasfilm’s using ‘Slave I’ much less prominently, most likely phasing it out. People who are bringing attention to it or disagree with the change aren’t stupid for doing so. The same applies to people who don’t have a problem with the change as well.

Of course, as always in the Star Wars fandom, they get drowned out by the sea of people screaming at them that “they’re a nerd and need to touch grass” for pointing out the change and by the sea of people screaming about “the woke left” for not a thinking it’s a big deal.","people who are saying that it was only changed for a lego set are wrong

4517,1,"/r/StarWars",0,"Those characters and everything surrounding them are some of the worst additions to Star Wars lately. They're like something out of a Luc Besson movie. And the creators committed a cardinal sin during the whole mod-parlor scene--using dateable music as a score. One of the reasons why Star Wars managed to be timeless is because it used timeless music as a score. Imagine if Episode IV had used the typical electronica most 1970s sci-fi had? It'd instantly be campy cult classic status. In the parlor scene, they used a techno beat that will sound completely dated in 10 years. Hell, it already sounded super cheesy.

I'm also convinced one of the reasons why they cut [Luke's scene with his friends at the Tosche Station](https://youtu.be/NVhvZctGYL8?t=64) from EpIV is because a group of youths who aren't the main protagonists instantly make the movie feel dated.
