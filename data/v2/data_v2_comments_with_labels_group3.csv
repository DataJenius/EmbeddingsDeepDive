44634,3,"/r/lotr",1,"Sorry but you're just factually wrong. His entire point was to make a historical mythology for the English, since the real mythology was wiped out after the norman invasion of 1066. He created a world based upon Germanic language, history, mythology and culture. In Tolkien's mind, these things ""happened"". Therefore the individuals in the story became the eventual inhabitants of britain. And since the inhabitants of britain were white before mass travel and immigration became more common, then skin colour is a factor. 

Take for example the story of Beowulf, if that story is taken as fact and not just legend then its events took place in 6th century Scandinavia.

I'm just so confused about this show.

1) They go how many episodes with Boba then randomly just cut to a Mando-centric two episodes. Felt so random.

2) They kind of kill the effect of the whole Mando Season 2 finale by having Grogu already reunite with him. I didn't mind him seeing him from afar last episode and you knew Grogu was going to have a choice but it feels so strange to make it not even in Mando's show. Because now they start Season 3 back together? What if you only watch Mando and not BoBF? So jarring and such an odd decision.

3) You bring in Cad Bane just to have him killed? If you haven't watched The Clone Wars you're like okay who's this blue guy? Oh well, he's dead. Again, strange. I'm fine with the death but they should have established him earlier or something. Seemed like a waste of his character appearing. Could have easily been some no-name. I was kind of expecting Maul or someone else syndicate-related to pop up but that's fine that he didn't.

4) I just still don't get why this show exists. Are they doing multiple seasons? I felt Boba worked perfectly in Mando as a side-arc character. I agree with someone else who had posted that this should have been called The Mandalorian: Book of Boba Fett. Then at least the jumping to Mando stuff could have seemed more natural.

From the very first scene of Luke talking with uncle Owen about his dad, there was a mystery there. And sure, Ben gave his explanation but clearly Owen didn’t approve of Ben all that much and we know next to nothing about Ben at that point (if watched in release order). 

In Empire, Luke and Leia kiss but in the same movie Yoda says there’s another hope for the galaxy, so clearly setting up…. Something? But it’s left open and return of the Jedi pays it off pretty well if you ask me.

TFA doesn’t set up anything other than Snoke is a bigger bad than kylo, and in TLJ Kylo gives a pretty convincing answer as to who Rey’s parents are. The mystery of Snoke is still there but it almost seemed like they were going to bury it with his death, and Rey’s parentage was given what we thought was a controversial pay off but a pat off nonetheless.

Fast forward to TROS. They give Snoke possibly the most half assed explanation not to be outdone by Emperor Palpatine “somehow returning” 

The set up and pay off is noticeably off in TROS as compared to its previous two movies. The reason? There wasn’t even a thought of planning the three together and they didn’t even leave it open in any way.

21721,3,"/r/StarWars",0,"As another fan of the sequels, I enjoy them for what they were as individual movies but their biggest flaw to me is the fact that they don't connect up as well as they could have. The best foreshadowing of Palpatine's return to me is episode 3 when he tells the story of Darth Plagueis which shows:

\- A means of cheating death exists amongst the sith and Palpatine had a connection to its creator.

\- Palpatine is very familiar with the concept of sith betraying their masters.

This is a pretty decent case for Palpatine surviving the OT and coming back in the future. I also felt like, for his status in lore as supposedly one of the most powerful sith lords in existence (Think Lucas said most powerful but not 100% sure of that, or if that still holds canon in current lore), he doesn't display a lot of actual force power relative to some sith that exist in extended lore, plus he dies to...his apprentice betraying him. After he betrayed and killed his master, Palpatine, the scheming mastermind who manipulated everyone to orchestrate the rise of the Empire, was betrayed and killed by his apprentice.

In his appearance in the sequels he actually shows power to bring down an entire fleet with force lightning, defies his first death, and more importantly, actually had a contingency plan for the single most common cause of death amongst sith lords, being betrayed by his apprentice. I do really wish they had built that up a bit more over 7 and 8 though, and especially actually showed his return broadcast.

The one thing I do think was actually planned somewhat, by JJ but not Ryan specifically, was Rey's heritage. There was evidence connecting her to Palpatine like her music and fighting style, and it was a theory I had actually felt had decent backing after Force Awakens.

25474,3,"/r/lotr",1,"I fundamentally disagree. It shows what the showmakers care about more. Because they never do the diversity thing in a way that is reasonable or preserves the suspense of disbelief, and for a fantasy show to be taken seriously it *must* preserve it, otherwise the audience will just go, ""well this is all silly nonsense"" and will tune out. For the audience to accept the fantastical elements, the mundane ones must be done realistically. After all, we know how this works in the real world. People living in the same location for many generations will eventually all kinda look alike, in terms of phenotype, unless there's some form of forced segregation according to those same phenotypes.

A good example of it done poorly is in WoT, where in a tiny, remote mountain village, you've got a whole of a dozen families, supposedly with deep seated roots in this village, having lived there for generations upon generations, each a different color. 

Now, either the show aims to tell us all their family trees are wreathes, or they didn't care about the internal consistency of the setting they're using. I would find it just as silly as having a bunch of white Wakandans just hanging out in Black Panther without anyone commenting on it. It takes you out of the story. 

Now, how it could be done well in this show, for example with the black Dwarf woman, is if her Dwarven society are black. After all, there were seven Dwarf-fathers, who's to say Aule didn't make one or more of them black. But they won't.

That's wrong. Its true that Boorman's original pitch was to do the Arthurian cycle, and he even admitted he thought The Lord of the Rings was impossible, but allowed himself to be convinced to do it.

Nevertheless, having committed to it, Tolkien seemed to have struck a chord with Boorman: as irreverent as his script is, its clear that he and co-writer Rospo Pallenberg have read through the appendices and understand the chronology of the events.

At 176 pages, the film would have made for three hours: same as early cuts of Excalibur: so we're looking at a 150-180 minute film, perfectly reasonable for the times.

Boorman also said he had met special effects people and scouted locations, so this was more than just writing - they were activelly gearing-up to shooting this thing. Pallenberg had removed all flying steeds from the script precisely to make it more feasible to make.

And after UA turned the script down he tried to keep it alive at Disney, where it languished for a while. Even after he made Excalibur, Boorman tried to make The Lord of the Rings at least two other times.

We also see Galadriel, and Gil Galad for instance. I think they've done a great job casting Galadriel and Gil Galad, based off that.

Well let's start off with the bad. 

Please for the love of god please just delete the modder gang, they were very -B movie-esque and shouldn't have gotten that much screentime action. Don't even get me started with their dialogue. (lmao) Okay secondly, they should've just killed off the twi'lek negotiator guy, i promise you most people would've been okay/happy about that. the dude just sucked the life out of the moment repeatedly in the series and was just flat out annoying. Also god, that ending with the Mandalorian felt super jarring and unsatisfying, even the post credits scene with the bacta tank felt like a deleted scene and practically left no continuation with any of the main characters. The only hints we got with Mandalorian Season 3 was for him to go back to the planet of Mandalore to restore his honor in an earlier episode. Outside of 3 episodes, yeah i'm not gonna watch this series again anytime soon.

Now let's get into the good! 

I saw someone earlier in this thread say they killed off cad bane too quickly. I very much disagree with that, I get that people think he's one of the more interesting star wars characters, but he's been around forever since the Clone Wars and has extensive history. Boba in the show was even like ""bro, you too old for this shit"". It felt super gratifying for Boba to kill him finally. especially, given the context where he's killed many clones that look exactly like him. That was one of the few things done right. Also that tandom of Fett and Djarin, and the riding of the rancor, that was **HEAT**. What really gets me excited about the future with Grogu is that he chose the beskar chain mail and be a foundling in that episode, which leaves me to believe.... 

(drum roll please)

... he's gonna be the *2nd* Mandalorian-Jedi after Tarre Vizla. I don't think there's any doubt in my mind about that. They don't just lightly hint at a lightsaber *and* beskar armor at the same time to not be used. It adds up too perfectly.

 Again, I really do want to like the finale and not come off as a hater, but come on, it was definitely below average. it's okay to admit that and be honest.","okay i believe i have some thoughts about the finale now for one i really do want to give that episode a thumbs up but i just cant 

well lets start off with the bad 

please for the love of god please just delete the modder gang they were very b movieesque and shouldnt have gotten that much screentime action dont even get me started with their dialogue lmao okay secondly they shouldve just killed off the twilek negotiator guy i promise you most people wouldve been okayhappy about that the dude just sucked the life out of the moment repeatedly in the series and was just flat out annoying also god that ending with the mandalorian felt super jarring and unsatisfying even the post credits scene with the bacta tank felt like a deleted scene and practically left no continuation with any of the main characters the only hints we got with mandalorian season  was for him to go back to the planet of mandalore to restore his honor in an earlier episode outside of  episodes yeah im not gonna watch this series again anytime soon

now lets get into the good 

i saw someone earlier in this thread say they killed off cad bane too quickly i very much disagree with that i get that people think hes one of the more interesting star wars characters but hes been around forever since the clone wars and has extensive history boba in the show was even like bro you too old for this shit it felt super gratifying for boba to kill him finally especially given the context where hes killed many clones that look exactly like him that was one of the few things done right also that tandom of fett and djarin and the riding of the rancor that was heat what really gets me excited about the future with grogu is that he chose the beskar chain mail and be a foundling in that episode which leaves me to believe 

drum roll please

 hes gonna be the nd mandalorianjedi after tarre vizla i dont think theres any doubt in my mind about that they dont just lightly hint at a lightsaber and beskar armor at the same time to not be used it adds up too perfectly

The other day I was watching a behind the scenes thing, and they mentioned how important silhouette was when designing a character. That you should be able to see a character at a distance, or in silhouette, and still know who that person is. The same applies to group recognition. Costumes and wigs aren't just about making the character look good, it can tell us so much more than that, immediately and without having to say or explain anything. You know someone's an elf at a glance because their look draws from the elves' theme. You can say that guy is from Gondor but this guy is from Rohan because they have different looks. That lady standing way over there is a dwarf and not a hobbit, because she has a beard.

If this was a different property, sure they could do whatever they want. Style the characters in whatever way the director thinks looks cool. But this is a story set in an established universe we've already seen. Hell, there are characters in it that we've already seen. We know what they're supposed to look like.

Moria has many doors, those doors are invisible if the one searching those doors doesn't meet some criteria, like a certain time of day while looking at it, a certain constelation being in the sky or any other moon or space related thing. To add to that, Khazad-dum (Moria) fell a long - and I mean a LONG - time ago. The dwarves knew of ""Durins Bane"" but with time they forgot what exactly it was. Balin went back after the events of ""the Hobbit"" to fight for Moria and won. He took almost the entire kingdom back (or so he thought) and rebuild many things. At that point he sent the news that everything was fine and became ruler of Moria. Quickly after that they were absolutely overrun by the orcs and were slowly but surely pushed back and starved out, after a few minor battles the survivers retreated to the chamber of mazarbul, laid Balin who was shot by 3 arrow at night to rest and wrote about their last days in the book they find. The other dwarves in Erebor didn't know about that and thought Moria was fine - no, noone ever traded with those dwarves, since Saurons forces actively tried to ally themselves with these dwarves and after they failed at those attempts they fought a full blown war. That's why we never saw other dwarven armies arive to help them at any point. 



The doors were made by Celebrimbor, a great elven craftsman, who forged the 3 elven rings of power. He was a great friend of the dwarves of Durin and therefore used the elvish words as a sign of friendship. But after Moria fell and the dwarves and elves began to hate each other, the knowledge became lost.



Flying to mordor was never an option. Sauron has incredibly good airial defense. From flying creatures, swarms of bats, clouds of shadows, fire rains to an ungodly amount of archers and balistas. Gandalf meant that they should run away and not try to save him. 



Aragorn knew that everyone in the fellowship would fall to the ring, so he knew Frodo and Sam had better chances on their own.

We can say that certain characters would never do X by looking at how they're characterized. 

Harry Potter would never sell his friends for greater power.

Indiana Jones would never hunker down and beg for mercy during a fist fight.

Sam would never betray Frodo out of selfishness.

And Luke would never contemplate killing a member of his family in their sleep. It would be even more unlikely in Ben's case because Luke knew him from birth, as opposed to Vader.

1) Did anyone else think it took them an embarrassingly long time to realize the droids were ray-shielded? In other movies/series they figured it it out much sooner.

2) I thought riding a rancor would take “much discipline and training”, but it seems here that a few days in the dungeon is all it needs. The rancor is even able to obey his commands! Hell he doesn’t even have to, he literally lifts a pike up to Boba so he can kill it. At least he rode it… LIKE A BANTHA :D

3) The Cad Bane vs Boba fight should’ve been more climactic. Their history goes back so far that their 2 minute scuffle just wasn’t all that fulfilling imo. Also, why would Bane wait till the pikes have clearly lost the battle to join?

4) So you’re telling me that Grogu’s back simply to be Din’s force-sensitive plot armor? Also I’m sure there were several situations where Din could’ve totally gotten himself out of, but instead chose to make like an old man and say “help, I’ve fallen and i can’t get up!” When he was pinned down against the droid and rancor, couldn’t he have used his jet pack to dodge the attack? What was his plan if Grogu was distracted by a womp rat, accept his fate? 

5) I was half expecting something related to Mando season 3 or a future series for the end credits scene, but just Vanth? The writing was mid to the end.

6) ITS THE SEASON FINALE. Why was it written so mediocrely? I’m honestly disappointed.","few things i didnt like from the episode

Bane vs Boba was excellent, though I suppose a few extra fight scenes between them before the final kill would’ve been good. Just hammer home the brutality it takes for one to finally kill the other.

The final scenes where Boba is uncomfortable being Daimo, and seems to want out were odd but also echoed my own thoughts. WHY does Boba want to be a Crime Boss.....who doesn’t really *do* crime.

I suppose it’s Boba feels too cuddly and kid-friendly. If anything he should be on the slightly colder, sociopathic side of Mando, still with honour and a code, maybe wanting to protect occasionally but first and foremost a capable killer.

I’m really hoping for S2 they give Boba a more focused goal that allows his hunter side to be on more display, and based on fan response actually LET HIM be a badass for once.

That ending scene where the Pykes are all killed was great but it should never have been Fennec who did it.

Replace the mods with almost anything and I think the series does a little better.

Most of the action sequences for EPs 1-4/7 were a mixed bag. Like, MCU levels of zero feeling of stakes. Having a whole ass fucking conversation while dealing with those bots and standing out in the open really made the threat feel nerfed.

The Pikes were also a very uninteresting villain and I can't get over how much they look like Klaus in the ""Tearjerker"" American Dad episode.

Just a really weird show that, frankly, were it not for the Mandalorian stuff would have been a pretty dismal overall effort. 

Boba should have been a background character in his own show - at least in the present day stuff.

Which is emblematic of the whole show, to be honest. Weird structure and editing choices sucking out all the story's tension (like, why did Shand murder the head Pike *after* the battle was over and they had already decided to leave?

The whole show just feels really messy and unfocused, like the creators have four competing visions for what it should be (Mando season 2.5/Boba as crime lord/Boba as small town sheriff with a dark past that comes back to haunt him/the Book of Fennec Shand), and rather than picking one just decided to go with all of them at the same time.","i like what they were trying to do they wanted to go with a spaghetti western vibe and it wouldnt make sense to do a drawn out fight scene in that context the problem is they already did that scene  times better last episode twice which makes this one feel super anticlimactic narratively speaking this was the starkiller base of shootouts

41492,3,"/r/lotr",1,"I did just “I have a black friend”, but it was bait. 

I didn’t say that not being white means I can’t be racist. I was surrounded by racism. Colorism in every direction. It influenced my biases and prejudices until I moved to the US. One could surely assume I’m racist, and they might be right, due to my upbringing. I take a nuanced approach now because I’m engulfed in US culture. Racism is significantly less prevent (and less violent) than in Central American countries.

I did read the author’s take. I can judge this take as well. 

A reflection of culture is a work of art. That doesn’t make it inherently immune to judgment, criticism, or feedback. 

For example: Jane the Virgin, Ugly Betty, and Saints and Sinners are American TV shows adapted from Latin telenovelas. They are significantly better than the source material. 

Why is that? Well, it’s not because they have more white people or because they’re whitewashed. It’s because American entertainment is better overall. There are better writers, directors, producers, actors. That’s a result of the economic advantage the US has. 

Now, let’s think about a different example. Let’s turn the tables. Metástasis is a Colombian remake of Breaking Bad. It entirely replaces any aspects of American culture (for the most part) in order to appeal to Colombians, but the story elements are fairly untouched. 

It’s one of the worst adaptations I’ve ever seen. But it ingrained Colombian culture, right? It’s a reflection of the showrunner’s culture. But it’s objectively bad. The acting is abysmal, the dialogue just doesn’t work, and the cinematography just isn’t as good as the original.

Cultural/inclusive adaptions do not equal quality.

A Honduran adaptation of Harry Potter would be awful because Honduras is a third world country with 90%+ of people living below the poverty line. There would be no budget and there is a minuscule entertainment industry there as it is.

I spent most of my life in Honduras watching DBZ, Gundam, Ranma 1/2, etc. I didn’t self-insert into those shows, but I understand that some people are like that. That’s fine. I appreciated those specific works because they were a reflection of a culture completely unknown to me. That was the amazing part. All of those shows had their own identity without needing to appeal to what I was used to.","i did just i have a black friend but it was bait

It could be considered a needless change that makes it less faithful, which is pretty annoying. If it’s not of narrative significance though, it’s like a mild inconvenience more than something that’s gonna ruin the show.

Sorry, but that's bullshit. We have several characters in the first movie thay act like book Faramir. Gandalf, Galadriel, Aragorn are all examples of this. Even movie Boromir managed to resist visible temptation twice on screen before he succumbed at the end of the movie. Once when he held it in his own hand.

This change portrays Faramir as one of the few Men that immediately succumbed to the temptation of the Ring. Meaning this portrayal implies that he has far less self-constraint and willpower than his brother.

And then we come to the point where he let go of Frodo and Sam. Nobody in his right mind would've let Frodo go to Mordor alone after witnessing what he did at Osgilliath: coming out of his hiding place and offering the Ring to a Nazgul. Take the damn thing away from him or send him to Minas Tirith immediately.

In it, a Force-sensitive man named Brakiss was trained by the Inquisitorius from childhood. Some years after the fall of the Empire, he was sent undercover to Luke's Jedi Academy on Yavin 4 to sabotage it, and steal whatever secrets and training he could.  
  
Luke instantly figured out what was going on, yet decided to train him anyways, working to turn him to the Light Side. However, he ultimately failed, and Brakiss fled the academy, becoming an apprentice to the Dark Jedi Kueller (another former student of Luke's Academy).  
  
Eventually, the Imperial Remnant and New Republic signed a peace treaty, and Brakiss joined up with a bunch of warlords who refused to honor the accords, forming the Second Imperium led by a resurrected Emperor Palpatine.  
  
Brakiss and a group of exiled Nightsisters were put in charge of the Shadow Academy, a Dark Side version of Luke's Academy, dedicated to training an army of Dark Jedi to serve the Emperor, who eventually sends them to Yavin 4 to wipe out the Jedi Academy as proof to the Imperial Remnant that they should break the peace and swear loyalty to the Second Imperium.  
  
However, their assault on the Academy fails. They manage to cause some limited destruction, but take heavy losses.

Not really. The usual 4 in 1 mail and just mail in general does not deflect. Historical accounts tell us arrows would be sticking out of mail when they are struck. Sometimes arrows could kill, but when they strike they'll be stuck without penetrating deeply.

>...drawn up in front of the cavalry, stood firm as a wall, and every foot-soldier wore a vest of thick felt and a coat of mail so dense and strong that our arrows made no impression on them...

>  
>72. Bahā'al-Dīn, ""The Life of Saladin"" (Ch. CXVII), in What Befell Sultan Yusuf, by Abu el-Mehasan Yusef ibn-Rafi ibn-Temun el-Asadi

When people with mail are struck by arrows, while the arrows may not pierce enough that it kills them, the blunt force transferred by the impact of the arrow sticking is still potentially deadly. The arrows aren't really being deflected off.

>And when he \[Benkin\] was aiming at the besiegers, his drawing on the bow was identified by everyone because he would either cause grave injury to the unarmed or put to flight those who were armed, whom his shots stupefied and stunned, even if they did not wound. \[76\]

Crouched lances on horseback striking mail also will usually kill the wearer by coming at them hard and fast. Swords don't get deflected either, they'll strike the mail but not penetrate or break the links & instead transfer blunt force.

>Such weapons of percussion were especially effective against mail armour; repeated blows could shatter bones and kill the victim without even breaking a single riveted link of his hauberk. In this situation the flexibility of mail, an advantage in other respects, was a positive disadvantage."" \[94\]

Mail is usually defeated by some form of blunt damage, you could strike harder and heavier to transfer force or quicker with more attacks. It does not function like an energy shield does.

People didn't really attack slowly with swords, they had to be fast and precise. You may use half swording against mail as depicted in some treatises if you do use a sword. [Here's a video of someone using half swording to show you how fast you may be striking someone](https://youtu.be/2bdMfaymGlk).

If you are thinking of deflection, you may be thinking of [later sloped plate armour](https://i.pinimg.com/736x/f1/5a/7a/f15a7ae2d28ccd14f38993f7ebb0acd7--landsknecht-armures.jpg). These could prevent projectiles that strike deflecting into areas you don't want them to go. [Here is an example of this happening on a breastplate](https://youtu.be/DBxdTkddHaE?t=1193). You can see a cool bit of protection for preventing arrows that strike from snapping upwards into the neck.

34247,3,"/r/lotr",1,"That’s a valid critique. I have three separate responses. 

The first is that it’s not really relevant to the spirit of OP’s complaint. OP is not just saying that this proposed storyline is playing out at the wrong point on the timeline, he’s saying that it’s not even Tolkienian. Commenters are responding by calling this girl-bossing. This discourse isn’t about whether or not this is a valid or invalid reorganization of the timeline…… this is about modern politics. The spirit of this post is about a perceived violation of the spirit of Tolkien in the name of pushing a modern political agenda, and the response to this post only solidifies that characterization. 

So I respond with a depoliticizing observation. Galadriel WAS the person that OP quotes the article as describing. Making her a “girl boss” is not pushing an agenda, it’s how Tolkien wrote her at one point of her life. 

Couldn’t a much more fruitful conversation be had if we got interested in discussing the merits or faults of reorganizing this timeline from the perspective of *storycraft* rather than from the perspective of modern political divisions? 

My second response is doing that, which is to say that I think it’s certainly not out of left field to move her personality growth in this way. I can see how having Galadriel as her younger personality would help meet the unique needs of show-running this story as opposed to novel-writing it. 

That doesn’t mean that I think it’s GOOD that they did so, only that it’s a valid option given the story they are trying to tell and medium through which it is being told. The merits of that choice, story-wise, can be debated independently. 

And lastly, I think we are still prone to overestimate her character growth. We forget that the Galadriel we knew is not Galadriel as she was…. It is Galadriel as she was seen through the eyes of a hobbit. Lord of the Rings (as well as the legendarium as a whole) is brought to us by a deliberately unreliable narrator. That’s a choice that Tolkien went out of his way for and took great care to stress, and we can see him treating his own text through the lens of the unreliable narrator. 

And that’s what elevates the story to a whole new level. It’s a *good* thing that we are given permission by this literary device to read new meanings into the text and speculate about how it may have been “for real” once you strip away the mythification and idealization of the narrators.","thats a valid critique i have three separate responses

11092,3,"/r/StarWars",0,">I don't know of any character developments that happened in this whole season. Who grew? Who wanted something and got it? Or didn't get it?

I'm gonna argue that there was some growth, however overall I think this critique is a good one and I basically agree with you. (On this point and most of your other points as well.) The characters are all tropey and what character development exists is way undercooked. Character development should have been given more airtime, but since it wasn't, the show feels emotionally empty outside of the mandalorian characters and the tusken raider plot, which, surprise, was actually given the space to grow and therefore had emotional heft.

But anyway, what little character development there was that all needed more attention in order to be satisfying:

* Fennec going from ""if I do this my debt is paid"" to being Boba's BFF. They give us some shots of both these characters' stoic faces showing some twinges of emotion and vulnerability during the episode showing how they teamed up, but other than that we have no idea why Fennec decided to go from being a badass self-serving bounty hunter to playing Stardew Valley with Boba.
* Boba himself undergoes a profound change, from being, again, the ruthless and self-serving Boba Fett established by lore up until now, to being a benevolent and honorable community leader. I think it's believable on paper that his time with the Tuskens could have changed him that much, but in classic Star Wars fashion, the show does a terrible job of showing how much time passes while he's with them. It seems like maybe a few weeks at most when it's literal years. Although the growth of his relationship with the sand people, and then grief at their slaughter is all well represented, I don't think the audience is given enough to really believe (or even realize) the massive evolution he undergoes during this time.
* The allies Boba gains over the course of the season: the modders, Krrsantan, and the gamoreans all started off against Boba but became loyal friends when he showed them the same kindness and hospitality the tusken raiders showed him. Is any of this actually satisfying or good? Not really. (Maybe Santo a little bit because their road from enemies to friends was a bit more drawn out than the others.) But it is...there. There was an attempt.","i dont know of any character developments that happened in this whole season who grew who wanted something and got it or didnt get it

Until then, stop digging up ghosts for gratuitous cameos. Think of a real story before you bring them back. Even if it’s only as good as The Force Awakens… that honestly felt good enough.

i have a feeling mark hamill didnt voice luke in this show for a reason it doesnt make any god damn sense any more except for money  you went into this with no foresight or overarching plan until you realized your error scrambled and cobbled one hell of a bloated and gratuitous franchise together using the ghost of  you literally let  directors take pot shots at each other in some messy star wars trilogy sandwich 

stop insulting lucas and the ot learn from history learn from your mistakes rise of skywalker cant have felt good secrets only the sith knew dont play with peoples emotions just have it turn out to be for nothing jesus if youre gonna resurrect boba fett or emperor palpatine or luke skywalker let it be for an actual reason flesh out their stories boba and the tuskens was the was the only time thats happened and it was movie magic where did that go

if youre just gonna seduce us nerds with luke porn to fill gaps in your writing leave him out of it mando and grogu are legitimate fresh content do them and do them big until then stop digging up ghosts for gratuitous cameos think of a real story before you bring them back even if its only as good as the force awakens that honestly felt good enough try to get back there if you can or make new content with grogu and mando"

Which runs counter to Tolkien's vision and what I personally love about his work. Do I know that's what will happen? No. But it has happened to almost every other series or body of work that's core theme was hope before being modernized. So I think that fear is well founded right now, even if it proves unnecessary after the show comes out.

The pikes don't really seem that much of a threat since the only reinforcements Boba received were a few civilians from Freetown, and his Rancor.

Cad Bane not joining the battle until after the Pikes are on the verge of defeat is dumb, though he was badass.

Why couldn't Fennec just take out the leader of the Pikes like 4 episodes ago? 

Bane's death was okay - although I feel like they should have had flashbacks to their time in the clone wars. 

Where is the female warrior Tusken? Is she dead? Her body wasn't at the camp, so where is she?

Cobb Vanth being alive didn't need its own end credit scene, people pretty much knew this already.

The action scene with Mando and Boba was awesome, but the extended shootout was terrible, awful awful directing.

I can't believe the Pikes didn't hire any more muscle, like no Bossk for instance?

Last episode felt rushed, kinda reminded me of the Battle of Winterfell, this big bad threat was dealt with in the space of 1 episode.

XXL Droidekas being op was dragged out for far too long.

Grogu should not have shown up in this episode at all. Should have been saved for S3 Mando.

The statue of a Numenorean king at the crossroads in Ithilien ""The eyes were hollow and the carven beard was broken, but about the high stern forehead there was a coronal of silver and gold"".

3: the only reference to beardlessness in Numenoreans is from Unfinished Tales, which is not cannon and is directly contradicted by canonical work.

4: Even if you want to stand on the Unfinished Tales reference about  Numenoreans not having beards Aragorn is the 64th descendant of Elros who himself wasn't a full blood elf. If Numenoreans like that depicted on the statue  at the crossroads could have developed beards then the modern Dúnedain with their mixed blood should be able to grow beards too.

TLDR: There is no wiggle room in the lore for non bearded dwarves while there is a strong case to be made for bearded Numenoreans.

So no, its not the same size issue at all.","theres multiple reasons why non beaded female dwarves is a bigger issue than aragorn and other numenoreans having beards its an apple to oranges comparison

All other comments: Talking shit about Robert Rodriguez 


In any case I agree that Rodriguez is a terrible fit for Star Wars (obviously the writing had some serious issues as well). 

Also after watching the Mandalorian episodes of this show I realized that Din’s helmet is actually a much more powerful device in enhancing the depth of his character than I remembered. 

I think they had a lot of potential with the Tusken Raider story line as to shaping who Boba Fett is becoming, but I feel the writers and directors failed to actually tell us who Boba Fett is at his core. The flashbacks of his personal life mostly told us things we already knew or could have assumed. 

We also didn’t learn anything about Fennec either. Her character was basically relegated to a narrator and almost all her decisions were ignored even though she is Boba’s primary consul. At the same time Boba goes around taking suggestions from the random youths in the seriously out-of-place mod gang (my least favorite part of the show).

Also absolutely no disrespect to Temuera Morrison or Ming-Na Wen- I think they did as best as actors could with the terrible writing and directing they encountered for much of the show.

i think Disney wanted the 2nd live action show released to skew more kid-friendly, and it just so happened that Favreau wrote a story that (he felt) needed Mando to come out first. which may have been a marketing 'mistake' when considering how much more conducive Fett would have been to weightier action and grittier tone. not to mention grogu is a perfect kid-centric marketable character.

so the Spy Kids / Sharkboy & Lava Girl director would be a 'better fit' for what Disney wanted to accomplish, not necessarily for Favreau or other talents' intentions. i bet Disney expected a bit more 'whole family affair' from their SW property, and insisted the 2nd show be that way. cause in my opinion, it really really is. i bet that's even partly why Boba took his helmet off so much - the helmet probably scared very young kids away from Mando lol. i can hear a Disney exec making this note and sending it down the chain of command.

i do not like it, but i think i can find peace in the fact that everyone understands Disney, so there's no point in being surprised at what we know Disney does. hopefully, they've all come to an agreement that Mando S3 doesn't skew kid friendly, but stays where it's been at in tone and 'serious' pollish.","now that its the day after and ive slept on it i think i have a theory on what happened imho mando is pg and bobf is pg

30970,3,"/r/lotr",1,"I'll answer as best as I can:

1. Sauron put the majority of his power into the ring to anchor him to the world and bind all the other rings to his will. Sauron is a being of energy that makes a physical body for himself. When he had the ring taken from him his body didn't have enough power to keep itself together.
2. Their biology DOES make their feet large, also the tops tend to be thick with fur like an animal to keep them warm and the bottom of their feet are harder than boot leather. Frodo stomping out the fire the twins made with his foot wasn't an act of self-destructive desperation, it was what a hobbit could safely do. 
3. They are otherworldly, caught between life and death. Their words are dreadful and their speech black. For all we know they are actually talking without making the effort to be understood by men. 
4. The elements have their champions, the ring wraiths don't like water and it takes a lot to force them over water.
5. Wizards are not ALLOWED to channel their powers except through their staffs. Wizards are actually angels allowed to take physical form and help/enable the forces of middle earth. Each has their own task set forth by their archangel as well as an overarching ""try to make the world a better place"" goal. If a wizard tries to use their powers without a staff they die from a failsafe. 
6. Because the ring wraiths are stuck, they can't grow and are in stasis. The blade disappeared to reappear at the side of the ringwraith, as it always does, as it always will do. They are locked. 
7. Elves are lighter, and they have some horse energy. A light as a feather elf speaking the language of the horses carrying a hobbit is faster than even a ranger who weighs more.
8. Yes they are afraid of water, but also that river marks the border of the lands Elrond holds, you see them get slapped down for trying to enter in the next part.
9. There have been three ages of middle earth, the first was the elves coming over and everything being INSANELY AWESOME but also terrifying. Elves crafted kingdoms, rules continents, and entire armies of elves fought each other or the terrors of Sauron's master. There was a dragon larger than mount doom that got beat by a guy flying a sailing boat using the power of a gem filled with the last lights of the trees of golden and silver light that were eventually used to make the sun and moon... Second age was the elves trying to keep things going the way they liked it and failing, third age is the age of nostalgia where the elves are feeling the weight of their years and eventually want to leave the now boring middle earth and go back to the undying lands where archangels literally hold court or teach elves how to craft things. 
10. Nothing evil likes the light of the sun, but only a few things are actually killed by it. Saruman is breeding stronger orcs that are organized and less tribal barbarians and more primitive organized military. They are physically stronger by a little bit and hardier which makes them more likely to fight in daylight than others. 
11. Frodo is bound to the ring because he wore it. Even though it didn't hurt the ring, the ring still sent out a ""HEY SOMEONE JUST TOOK A SHOT AT ME!"" to get someone to pick it up.
12. Could be anything, there are a bunch of languages. Maybe elven, but the fact that Saruman is an angel that used to work for the archangel of the winds themselves means he might actually be speaking the language of the wind.
13. That isn't direct sunlight, it might be reflected light from something else, the moon, lanterns, or etc. It seems like there needs to be direct a to b sunlight though as the trolls weren't turned to stone by ambient rays from the dawn until the sun itself shown directly on them.

I say “people are fallible” as an explanation because these mistakes arise from a characters flaws. In Batman’s case, his fatal flaw which leads to this situation is his failure to acknowledge his own vulnerabilities, he’s still acting like he did in his youth without allowing for the fact that he’s a normal man, an aging man. And because he fails to live with that reality, he gets himself in a situation where he has to use a gun to save himself, the one thing he swore he would never do. His pride is his downfall. 

And in Luke’s case the story is very similar. He pridefully believed that he was the hero *Luke Skywalker*, that he had everything under control and that the Jedi Order would prosper under his singular tutelage. He thought he could be a good master to Ben, but when he looks inside Ben Solo’s mind and sees a great evil that has the power to one day wipe all that out, for a moment he thinks he can stop it.

15482,3,"/r/StarWars",0,"I have some thoughts about the season as a whole that I want to type up while everything's still fresh in my memory.

Overall I liked it. Below I'm going to list a bunch of criticisms of the show, but I'm bothering to write all this up because I think these Mando/Boba shows (and potentially the upcoming shows too) have potential to be something really neat. Watching this show I get the sense that the creative decision-makers behind it actually really like Star Wars, and instead of cranking out a story formula they think will sell a lot of theatre tickets and merch (like the sequel trilogy) they are creating something that star wars fans will think is cool.

Luke and Ahsoka having a friendship of some kind? Cool. Luke training the next Yoda? Cool. Boba Fett develops into a more substantial character that's not just some edgy badass? Great. Expanded lore on Tatooine and its people and cultures? Moving along the story of Mandalore? Slowly unraveling the mystery of what Yoda's species is and what makes them so special? Absolutely tantalizing. Boba Fett riding a rancor and obliterating massive droidekas? **Fucking. awesome.**

I don't know how you can be anything but positive about any of this stuff. But, the show is clearly not a masterpiece and they have a long way to go to be in the same league as shows that are actually, you know, really good.

Here are my random specific thoughts:

**Stormtrooper continuity error in ep1**

* Opener of Ep1, Boba wakes up in the sarlacc and gets oxygen from a dead stormtrooper's suit. This is already a continuity error because **there were no stormtroopers present at the battle of Jabba's barge.** Could the sarlacc have swallowed a stormtrooper at some other time? Sure, but it would have to be pretty recent for that suit to not be dissolved and the oxy tank still functioning. But there was no empire on the planet in ROTJ so...it just makes no sense. The only explanation as far as I'm concerned is that this is a very clumsy continuity error, which is very unfortunate because it's thrown right in your face in the opening moments of the episode. A shame.

**Tatooine worldbuilding**

* Tatooine as a setting: this point isn't a criticism actually. But in recent Star Wars productions I've been getting really tired of constantly returning to Tatooine. It's supposed to be an absolute backwater in the outer rim, the definition of the middle of nowhere. But with the amount of stories that get told there, the number of significant characters who visit and important things that happen, it feels more like the center of the Star Wars universe. And honestly, I wasn't looking forward to this show having even more Tatooine. But I was pleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed the expanded lore of tusken raiders, and even getting a better sense of the planet's geopolitics, social castes, cultures and peoples...all of that was pretty fascinating. Just these 7 episodes made me go from being absolutely Tatooined out to....well, they could make it the main setting for the rest of this show and I wouldn't mind, as long as they keep up the worldbuilding that this season had.

**Character development is undercooked and that robs the show of a stable emotional core**

* I already wrote this out in longer form [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/so7z3y/comment/hwbrkdh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), but the TLDR is, character development is sort of happening but it didn't get enough screentime to make events of the show emotionally resonate the way they could. Boba especially undergoes a profound evolution, becoming basically a different person while he spends **years** with the Tuskens, (which the show makes seem like a couple weeks maybe.) While the way he acts afterward is certainly different from the Boba we know, the show somehow failed to drive home the understanding to the audience that he has undergone this seismic change in his outlook, goals and behaviour. I'm not really sure how they missed the mark, because one bit of character development that's adequately done in these episodes is the arc of his relationship to those sand people. When they're all killed, it's the saddest moment of the season and you know Boba's devastated. But there's nothing to show how deeply this affects him. We don't see him really struggle with the transition from bounty hunter to benevolent nobleman. He just stoically adapts to everything that happens and there's no sign his entire psychology is being rewired. So everyone makes this criticism of, ""he seems like a different character,"" and that's because he is, but the show failed to animate the process of that transformation.
* This same issue of undercooked character development affects other characters as well, like Fennec, whose motivation for following Boba into the civic life is a total mystery, other than basic factors like mutual respect and gratitude for saving her life. But those aren't nearly enough to explain her motivation IMHO.

**A bunch of battle logistics that made no sense in the finale**

* I am normally not a stickler for this kind of thing, so you know that if even I kept noticing this stuff, it must be pretty bad. But honestly I'm too tired after writing all the above to go into more detail about this but I'm sure lots of other people have it covered. But this was really an unfortunate distracting element in a finale that I otherwise liked a lot. I think the overall concept was 10/10, but they really stumbled in having the details play out in a logical and believable way.

**Edit: Important addition: the actual takeover/Bib Fortuna's death**

* why...the fuck....was this part shown as this really quick little dreamlike montage? I can't even remember what episode it was in now but it was so strange. Like, Bib Fortuna was a pretty memorable supporting character from ROTJ. But the weird way they decided to gloss over this part of the story didn't make, like, cinema-storytelling sense to me, if that makes sense. It was just so weird and I thought that scene was a flash-forward and we'd see it actually play out later. But nope, that was it.","i have some thoughts about the season as a whole that i want to type up while everythings still fresh in my memory

Elves are distinct from humans (even with changes between them, for example Legolas looks different than Elrond orHaldir  but you can tell that all those people were elves). Humans from Rohan were distinct from Gondorians and Rangers and of course very distinct from Easterlings and Haradrim and Umbars.

ghost in the shell was panned because it had a white protagonist in a pure asian story and setting  were those people racists that didnt like johansson to play a character that in that story and in that world should be asian

They clearly don't want to take any risk with the franchise, having the FO being a carbon copy of the empire, Rey being on Tatooine 2.0 and even the TV series largely taking place on Tatooine.  

So let me imagine another scenario we could have had. This time with the Dark Jedis and the Nightsisters. 

The first one could have started as a small group of Luke's students who disagreed with the core tenets of the school. Might even be because they were all recruited as teenagers or young adults and did not see how traditional Jedi could resolve the injustices of the galaxy.

The Nightsisters would be the ones behind the scenes, promising a better way while slowly corrupting the minds of the first group. 

On top of this, it would give an interesting storyline to the old cast. 
* Luke has to deal with the shortcomings of the Jedis and the lure of the Dark Side promising simple solutions to very complex problem. 
* Leia realizes that liberating the galaxy was just a first step and that democracy can easily fall when you don't pay attention (good parallel with Amidala). 
* Han desperately tries to sway his son back to the good side, after having spent most of his life as a smuggler and a known criminal. 
* Chewie, R2-D2, C3-PO keep the same roles as silent  mentors and comedic factors

It doesn't take a mind reader to perceive as such a statement that is clearly written to suggest a certain point of view. I don't know why you insist on pretending otherwise?

I suppose a live action version, if (and I hope they do) they choose to avoid Avatar-level CGI, is constrained by the human form and ability to use high level prostheses and costumes for many cast members. I.e., it would be a big ask to have people in costumes to look like some of the animated style characters, particularly in a TV show with extended screen time and action sequences. They managed it with orcs and Uruk-Hai, for example, but they had relatively limited screen time. 

I believe PJ's choices were largely driven by his underlying distaste for 'OTT magic' so he wanted to keep the films relatively grounded. I would imagine Amazon is taking a similar approach and wants to keep things (obviously only somewhat) in line with the films, in order to suggest connection between the two, at least to the casual viewer. 

I think PJ achieved good differentiation - the elves distinguish themselves from men largely through expression and demeanor, with costume and lighting coming second, I think; Hobbits and dwarves are quite well defined through costume and behaviour. 

&#x200B;

I guess they could or could have gone with something a little more outlandish, but I think the main reason that hasn't happened is loosely connected to part of Tolkein's purpose for LOTR in the first place: to create something that would be a new national myth and legend for the UK.

45656,3,"/r/lotr",1,"I’m not calling anyone a racist or a “Nazi.” The point that you’re making would be valid if we were talking about Bridgerton, or casting a black guy to play King Henry V. 

But Middle-Earth is fictional. To say that it’s “based upon medieval Europe” when it includes places like Mordor and Lothlorien, includes creatures like the balrog, includes rings of power and wizards and hobbits and orcs … surely none of THAT stuff was in medieval Europe, yes? So, it seems that Middle-Earth is already not COMPLETELY accurate to medieval Europe. 

What I don’t understand (and what I’d like for you to address) is this: if someone is a proponent of accuracy to medieval Europe, why would they be okay with the existence of fucking Balrogs, but not okay with the existence of black dwarves? Why is it that it’s okay for Tolkien to base SOME stuff upon medieval Europe, while pulling other stuff straight from his imagination or general fantasy lore, but when it comes to the Amazon show, it has to be PRECISELY accurate to medieval Europe? Why is it that skin pigmentation is more important than fucking magic? Why is it that, when it comes to locations or mythological creatures, it’s totally fine for Middle-Earth to not be accurate to medieval Europe, but when it comes to the skin color of the characters, Middle-Earth has to be EXACTLY accurate to medieval Europe? (assuming that there were zero people of color in medieval Europe, which I doubt tbh, but sure, let’s go with that)

It’s not so much that I’m “lost in my argument.” It’s that your argument isn’t that convincing. Middle-Earth is, if anything, LOOSELY based upon medieval Europe, and as such, the skin colors of the characters need also only be LOOSELY based upon medieval Europe.","im not calling anyone a racist or a nazi the point that youre making would be valid if we were talking about bridgerton or casting a black guy to play king henry v

So, I think you make fun of people who are actually saying that this Galadriel is bad because she is a strong female character - if that is what you are trying to say, then I agree, those people are dumb. But, I do have to say, that I dont like this version of Galadriel. She looks puny for what she is supposed to be, that armor looks ""interesting"" to put it nicely and she doesn't look as beautyful as she should. I dont mean, the access looks ugly, but for a 8 foot tall muscled amazon woman, with hair braided like a crown and unearthly beauty, she does look like someone any dude could find at the bar of a country club or something. She looks way too human and normal good - there is nothing special about her. If she was just supposed to be an elven commander, I'd still dont like her as much, but I could get over that, but as Galadriel she simply doesn't work for me. What I also find a bit of an unwise choice for her is full armor and a sword. I dont mind the horse (I really dont get why people are annoyed by that), she probably would be a pretty good rider, but a sword? For someone who is supposed to be more of a magic combatant and someone who fights defensively, she does seem a bit too much like an action hero instead of a wise commander who only fights to protect. I mean, if they dont have the right for that version of her, than they should leave her out. Why would someone adapt something they barely even have the rights for? That's absurd to do and it is even absurder to think that the fans wouldn't get upset about it. At this point you have no choice but to write fanfiction and at that point you should just leave it be and dump the project - what was always, in every adaptation, the biggest thing fans got mad about? Changes from the source. So making a show, completely based upon changes from the source seems stupid to me.

No I know. I understood that and agree. My criticism is that one of the two best plots in the series was Mando season 2.5 and that is BAD. If this is a show about Greedo then that makes sense, but a show about Boba Fett? Like I said, the walk and talks, the boring politics, basically the entire crime family storyline was garbage.

I'm not against him evolving and leaving the ruthless killer part of himself in the past but all the walking around with no helmet, talking a bunch and being a softy just isn't it.

> Grond crawled on. The drums rolled wildly. Over the hills of slain a hideous shape appeared: a horseman, tall, hooded, cloaked in black. Slowly, trampling the fallen, he rode forth, heeding no longer any dart. **He halted and held up a long pale sword. And as he did so a great fear fell on all, defender and foe alike; and the hands of men drooped to their sides, and no bow sang. For a moment all was still.**

This is the Witch King.  Greatest and most terrible of Sauron’s servants, his presence is enough to cause all to stop moving and be rooted in place with horror.  In the midst of a giant, crucial battle, this is the power and might he commands.  This scene interrupts the “flow” because it is a demonstration.  In this moment, it is clear to the reader: The Witch King will win, unless something can stop him, like Gandalf, or maybe Rohan, if they manage to come.  But it seems too late now.

And then we get probably my favorite passage from any book:

> The drums rolled and rattled. With a vast rush Grond was hurled forward by huge hands. It reached the Gate. It swung. A deep boom rumbled through the City like thunder running in the clouds. But the doors of iron and posts of steel withstood the stroke.
> Then the Black Captain rose in his stirrups and cried aloud in a dreadful voice, speaking in some forgotten tongue words of power and terror to rend both heart and stone.
> Thrice he cried. Thrice the great ram boomed. And suddenly upon the last stroke the Gate of Gondor broke. As if stricken by some blasting spell it burst asunder: there was a flash of searing lightning, and the doors tumbled in riven fragments to the ground.

The title of this post picks up from here.  A break in the action to show the power and terror of a big bad is incredibly impactful.","which is actually the entire point

this is the witch king  greatest and most terrible of saurons servants his presence is enough to cause all to stop moving and be rooted in place with horror  in the midst of a giant crucial battle this is the power and might he commands  this scene interrupts the flow because it is a demonstration  in this moment it is clear to the reader the witch king will win unless something can stop him like gandalf or maybe rohan if they manage to come  but it seems too late now

and then we get probably my favorite passage from any book

 the drums rolled and rattled with a vast rush grond was hurled forward by huge hands it reached the gate it swung a deep boom rumbled through the city like thunder running in the clouds but the doors of iron and posts of steel withstood the stroke
 then the black captain rose in his stirrups and cried aloud in a dreadful voice speaking in some forgotten tongue words of power and terror to rend both heart and stone
 thrice he cried thrice the great ram boomed and suddenly upon the last stroke the gate of gondor broke as if stricken by some blasting spell it burst asunder there was a flash of searing lightning and the doors tumbled in riven fragments to the ground

51327,3,"/r/lotr",1,"It’s not clear about the beards. We’re applying the transitive property in this case, which is essentially “if dwarven men have beards, and dwarven women look so alike to them as to be not differentiated in man/elven eyes, then that means they have beards also”. However, the transitive property is only solid in mathematics, and only goes so far in this case (we argue against the transitive property all the time in sports). So we can *infer* from this line that dwarven women have beards, but I’d hardly call that definitive. Again, just my opinion. 

The other line comes from volume 11 of the history of middle earth (war of the jewels), which states that dwarven men and women are born with beards. I actually ordered this book recently to read this line in context, because I couldn’t find anything similar to this in any of the 5 or so unfinished tales/lost tales books I have. This line to me is pretty definitive, but as anyone who reads the previously unpublished works knows, there is plenty of conflicting/changed information.

So in my opinion, beards on dwarven women is an extremely obscure fact, with plenty of room for argument. I’d say that the case for beards is stronger than the case against, only because there’s so little information to go by. 

To me this is somewhere around making orcs as tall (or taller) than men, or having Kili with basically just a 5 o’clock shadow in the film adaptations on the “breaking from established lore” scale.

53479,3,"/r/lotr",1,"It would definitely take an amazing physical being! Don't get me wrong. But I'm saying the difference between a great Man and a great Elf is probably not *super* apparent.

Glaurung was slain by a sword. Though through stealth. I'd say en Elf would need stealth too. They aren't pulling it off head on. Could a Man slay a Balrog head on?

43490,3,"/r/lotr",1,"Please don't get me wrong. I agree that there shouldn't be this kind of backlash for something that's fantasy. Hardcore fans will be mad but not for racist reasons. Other fairweather fans (or not even fans) who are also racist are pissed because well, you know. 

Miles Morales is different than what you're speaking of because it's a brand new regular kid who happens to be half black and half Puerto Rican. They didn't make Peter Parker change races. Not that that should even matter. That's a whole new character who took the mantle after the original Spider-Man died. Just like anyone pissed off that Captain America is black now can fuck off. It can be a (I kinda hate I'm using this term) slippery slope. Trans dwarves...Actually, that'd be pretty easy to implement. But the point being, it's...well, not as immersive as a fan. At what point is it no longer based on Tolkien's lore and just some fantasy that uses the namesake? Harry Potter transitioning into a female 80 years from now? If you're a fan, whatever gender, you'd be upset. 

Once again, I agree that this shouldn't be as big of a deal as this is made out to be by some. And you made great points, Galadriel being one of them. I still think this isn't trying to be inclusive because it's deserved or genuine. Rather, inclusivity for a cash grab. That's my only qualm with it. 

Just for the record, I do believe in inclusivity and representation. I couldn't give less of a shit if there is a black elf or dwarf. Some people do for the wrong reasons and fuck them. I still understand the side that wants to stay true to the lore. I don't personally care about that but I get it. The racist fucks complaining about this shit almost definitely know nothing about this universe anyway. They can go fuck themselves and they shouldn't have any children because they might further spread their bullshit. 

Also, I do hope it's a good show. I had my doubts to begin with, being Amazon and all, but you've made me further worry due to your background in the industry.

&#x200B;

If I could put all my thoughts on this show into 1 word, it would be confused. TBoBF successfully took what should be a straight forward concept (Boba becoming a crime boss) and turned it into a confused mess where things just kinda happen, an entire separate show appears in the middle, then it just kinda ends with a big action scene.

For the first half of the show the pacing is super weird. All of the flashbacks would have worked much better if they just started the show with Boba escaping the Sarlacc and working their way up from there. Just reorganizing the show with this in mind makes it so much easier to follow in the first 4 episodes, though it doesn't save it from the more strange narrative choices such as the Hutt twins being completely pointless and the modding gang being super out of place on Tatooine.

Boba himself seems to have no real motivation, and what little he has is very inconsistent, then he just says ""damn, I guess being a mob boss ain't for me!"". He also doesn't really do much, which is both a huge waste of the character and Temuera Morrisons' acting skills.

&#x200B;

I did a similar comment when The Bad Batch finished, and I talked about my favorite/ least favorite characters and episodes, but that really doesn't feel fair to do here because the best episodes and characters of course come from episodes 5-6, which are pretty much a completely different show for some strange reason. We could have just had Mando show up in TBoBF and then in season 3 of Mando we get these episodes, instead they awkwardly put them into this show just to get Grogu involved in the climax, which I think was a seriously poor narrative decision despite the fact I honestly loved it in the moment.

Speaking of things I liked in the moment: Luke. Like everyone else, I love me some Luke Skywalker, but wow on rewatch it really shows that he's now completely computer generated down to his voice. His lines are strange (probably because they couldn't get better lines to sound natural), he hardly emotes with his voice, and while the CGI is better, it still feels off. Though I can get over the look. They really just need to stick with a voice actor and not desperately try to cling to Mark Hamill's voice though this weird voice synthesizer.

&#x200B;

I guess my least favorite characters are the modding gang, but that mainly comes down to their aesthetics. You'd think a group revolving around augments on Tatooine would consist of Jawas and rogues, but I guess it's just a bunch of weird human teenagers/young adults? And of course the Power Ranger bikes were amazingly out of place. I guess that makes my least favorite episode #3.

&#x200B;

Episodes 5 and 6 could have been used so much better. We could have seen Boba actually interact with the town outside of the modding gang, see Boba learning to ride his Rancor, introduce Cad Bane earlier and expand on the Pikes and why this town is so important to them.

Final thoughts: This is a show that never really found out what it wanted to be, then it just became a completely different show halfway though before wrapping up. It really feels like some executive just decided ""lets have someone make a Boba Fett show, he's cool right?"" and then just got some people to direct a few episodes right afterwards.","tldr there was no book in the book of boba fett

The only difference is that the awful prequels spawned the Clone Wars and a host of great storytelling in other media that filled in the blanks and helped make sense of Anakin's rapid personality change.

But the sequels also have their moments, uninspired as they are. The buddy cop relationship (if not budding romance) between Finn and Poe. Sadly abandoned after TFA but still enjoyable to watch. Han just being Han. ""Hey, can I try that?"" Luke's last stand on Crait (some of the most breathtaking visuals in the entire franchise). Luke training Leia, etc. What the sequels are sorely lacking is the supporting media. Their own Clone Wars show.

It's obvious in TFA that Rey's parents arent showing up, she's waiting/suffering for something that won't happen.

The characters you did give me were 3 elves, 7 (of the 9) men and none of them were canon names so they're on par with Amazon's characters, and 7 dwarves, who you failed to name at all so they're again not really characters. 

If the show spends time in each kingdom that gets a ring, it will be even more vast than game of thrones. I don't think they'll do this, but if they did do that, you would NEED more characters to fill in around each ring bearer. Without more characters around them, you'd essentially be watching each what, sulk in their bedroom? Gaze out windows? Fondle their rings?

If we assume that instead of looking into each of their stories like game of thrones, and instead you have them in groups, for whatever reason, bunched together. This doesn't make sense as I highlighted before. Why would you have a bunch of lord's of realms just hanging out together? That would be super unrealistic in every sense. The assumption there would again be that the only people who do anything are kings, and for some reason none of them have champions or people who can do tasks for them. Everything they need done they must do themselves. That would be shit storytelling.

Now if we assume instead that this story will focus on one or a couple of the ring bearers (probably galadriel specifically) you have to give her characters to interact with. Those have to be characters who realistically would be around her, unless every episode she was just visiting one of the other ring bearers, and all they did was shang out alone together and talk about their rings, which is also stupid

So no, you end up with galadriel, and her friends and rivals along the way.

It's simple, and you're making it into something somehow simultaneously.more complex yet more stupid","first off you didnt give me thirty  there werent even  rings

the characters you did give me were  elves  of the  men and none of them were canon names so theyre on par with amazons characters and  dwarves who you failed to name at all so theyre again not really characters 

if the show spends time in each kingdom that gets a ring it will be even more vast than game of thrones i dont think theyll do this but if they did do that you would need more characters to fill in around each ring bearer without more characters around them youd essentially be watching each what sulk in their bedroom gaze out windows fondle their rings so even with all of them youd need more characters or youd have nothing

14148,3,"/r/StarWars",0,"All the points you've made... they're subjective viewpoints. 

I can rewrite them all with a different viewpoint. Neither of us will be objectively right. It's opinions.

* the big droids are designed to stand with their shields up, close to their opponents, and blast them until they're dead. If people run away they follow at the same pace. If people get on a speeder or transport, they *speed up*, because they more than one speed setting. At no point has a rule been set in stone that they can only move at a walking pace. That's your preconception, that you're trying to establish as some kind of plot inconsistency

* Boba Fett has no experience in politics or running a Crime Family. He's a bounty hunter with a specific skillset. A smart man relies on and listens to the experience of others before making decisions. It's actually the wisest thing to do, even if it didn't always go well for him.

* I'd never heard of Cad Bane before this show. My impression was that his introduction was pretty damn cool. He had a menacing air about him. He was exactly like the mysterious stranger that the title or the episode implies. You say he has no ""narrative point"". You may as well say Boba Fett had no narrative point in the original trilogy. He's a cool intriguing side character to fire up the imagination. A part of the world building. It's the same as Darth Vader and Obiwan discussing their shared past in throwaway lines in a New Hope. You see that Boba and this guy have history. They used him just the right amount, and I had no idea who he was.

* at no point is the Wookies foot shown to be broken or twisted half off. The moment he cones back into frame he's shown clearly standing on both feet, his weight spread evenly as he shoots enemies. As he runs towards the other he starts to limp and drag his foot. Your the one making all these assumptions about broken feet. There's lots of reasons someone might limp, especially if they're tired and just fought off large gang of attackers. I don't see why this is such a sore point for you. He's a Wookie. Tough as nails. After a rest he ignores whatever injury made him limp. It fits with everything I know about Wookies being badass

I could keep going. Are you really that put off by a rancor deciding to bite a head off? A lot of your points are so subjective like this. Its such a bizarre thing to find annoying. It makes you hypercritical. If everyone views escapist Scifi fantasy like you do, then I'm not surprised noone can enjoy Star Wars anymore. 

I might even agree with one or two of your points. Why did the trandoshians pull out knives? Maybe so that the experienced bounty hunter who's scanning the crowd wouldn't spot their weapons? Who knows. I don't view shows with your kind of mindset. I enjoyed rogue one too. do you know how many people hate that movie with passion? I disagree with them and a lot of their criticisms too. People saying Rogue One is objectively a bad movie

> Narrative consistency is a very basic part of storytelling. This episode, more than any previous one, has trouble from start to finish with this very important, very basic part of storytelling. It's fine if that doesn't bother you, but that doesn't make it subjective.

It absolutely does make your subjective opinions in Wether or not the Narrative is inconsistent, subjective. The fact that you can't even fathom that someone could disagree is pretty telling. You think your opinions are objective. They're not. You're probably going to counter all the counter points I just made, because they're my subjective points too. I accept this.

If I take the story of Mulan and decide that it doesn’t have enough Polynesian and Navajo representation, does it make it a bad movie? If I remake it to reflect the population diversity of today, will it make people feel good to be “represented”? Or is that just pandering?

And what about the class structures? Do you really think that even if there were major POC characters in these fictional works that they wouldn’t face any oppression and would be seen as equals by their peers? 

It’s just diversity for the sake of shoehorning current world views into works of fiction that represent cultural identity. 

It’s dumb.","its disingenuous because it attempts to portray the world of tolkien as a reflection of the world it is today not only that but it attempts to replicate the world of multicultural areas like lany where diversity is expected into a work of fiction

The huge drop in quality from the last two episodes compared to this one is very noticeable...it sucks because I was quite hyped for boba fett to get a show and see how they'd make him feel different than Mando, guess they managed that by making him have a much less interesting plotline and make him super passive and naïve. It wasn't the worst series just average compared to recent star wars projects.","seriously robert rodriguez is by far the worst thing to happen to this series the crime lord storyline was already meh but with his directing its easily so much worse the huge drop in quality from the last two episodes compared to this one is very noticeableit sucks because i was quite hyped for boba fett to get a show and see how theyd make him feel different than mando guess they managed that by making him have a much less interesting plotline and make him super passive and naïve it wasnt the worst series just average compared to recent star wars projects"

 And although there's no explicit mention of her fight in Second Age war, and the only mentions are her commanding an army and taking part in the defence of Eregion, I doubt she herself didn't fight when things were getting too much out of hand. Remember they were outnumbered by order of magnitude, and Sauron himself was leading his forces. 

Maybe if they actually had rights to Unfinished Tales they could make a more lore friendly version of her","i agree that rop gal is all over the top but she did fight in dire straits she herself fought when noldor were overwhelming the teleri

Generally, your assumption would make sense as directors tend to have more control as their career progresses, but in this case, Guillermo Del Toro was meant to direct The Hobbit and pulled out 3 months ahead of time (VERY close by filmmaking standards) due to scheduling issues. They didn’t have a director so Jackson stepped up. In addition they were created by different companies- New Line Cinema created and owns LOTR. They have the rights to the “look” of that film. MGM and Warner Bros did Hobbit. They did not have the rights to LOTR so they legally had to make Hobbit look as different as possible, visually, to avoid getting sued.

She’s calling the book old fashioned which, yes it is, because it’s an old book. That’s not right or wrong it just is. 

Peter Jackson updated the films to include larger roles for Arwen and Eowyn to reflect our more modern feelings on women having prominent roles in society. This is much ado about nothing especially if the product is a quality show. 

What she means about the biological is true. We don’t know the bio chemistry of the creatures of middle earth. Hence all the discussion around where black people in middle earth come from or do people have beards or not is silly. Not to mention Tolkien contradicts himself on a number of occasions when describing such things. So while yes some groups are described to some detail, it’s never in such an excruciating way that there’s zero interpretation by any historic representation of the characters. For example, pointy ears aren’t really a thing for elves. We ascribed that feature to them and it’s become mainstream since. But that isn’t actually hard canon. Same with long hair. 

And in truth, little aesthetic choices bare no mark on film quality. Aragorn had a beard in the films, Sam wasn’t brown, Frodo wasn’t 50, Gandalf didn’t have giant eyebrows. The quality of film is determined by the script, editing and performance. Hand wringing over getting the exact details of the book is fruitless and dishonest","she didnt call tolkien racist
