To clarify, You mean she's 27 At SA 1, and gains 23 years in the second age to be 51 at TA 1? and what's the difference between the 51 quoted and the ""mortal equivalent 38"" part? If 38 signifies her age in mortal years, what's 51 mean? Then at 72/54 in Fo.A 1 she has ended her youth phase? 

 I find that hard to believe that one of the oldest elves in Middle Earth would be ending 'the youth' of her life (if immortal beings can even be said to have a youth in that sense) at 8.5 millennia old... Older than all elves in ME except Cirdan, a truly ancient Elf (yet still, only ~3 millennia older than Galadriel)

Your second point, 

>The show is merging all the five plots into one timeline. We'll see Forging of the Rings and The Downfall without any major time jumps. 

Is kinda exactly what I'm worried about. Pretending P&V Galadriel, which has been defended as 'equivalent of mid-20s fiery Galadriel', and end of second age Galadriel are effectively the same character - in age, and I worry also, in bearing. And any growth (or lack thereof) she goes through in that time will happen within perhaps a few centuries? That doesn't jive with the point of Elves, that they are so wise because they have seen countless generations of Men pass before their eyes.

---

I also think of like equivalent elves -

Thingol was born soon after the elves awakened in YT 1050 and died FA 500 making him 4,300 - 4,800 years old. Galadriel end of SA is OLDER than the great king Thingol was when he met his demise.

Elrond at the end of the Third age is what, ~6,400? Probably closer to the type of bearing you'd expect a 5,400 year old Galadriel to have for the Akallabeth? 

And speaking of Elrond, I am wondering what this wonky time compression will do to him. His twin brother Elros became the first King of Numenor in SA 43. So Elrond will have been alive for *every reign of every Numenorean Ruler*. Shit, the founding King was his own *twin* brother! I worry that, in the show, Elrond will come off as young and naive in the way mortal ~20-year-olds can. Despite him having seen 3 millennia, and being as old as Numenor itself, as old as the reigns of 22 long-lived Numenorean Kings and Queens.","so i havent read nature of me but are you saying the rate at which elves age is different than just a linear  elven years   mortal equivalent year ratio which you quoted first thats an assumption i was making based on your own saying so

"187",15750,4,"/r/StarWars",0,"Well I enjoyed this one a lot more than episode 6, but I wouldn't say it's a good finale. It wraps things up that either weren't properly set up or were only set up in the previous episode. I just don't feel like I've spent enough time with these characters to fully enjoy this as a finale, much as I liked the battle. I don't really know the vespa gang or what they want, I don't know the rancor, I don't know the people of Freetown all that much. Krr'santan is a bit more well-defined but I also read some of his comic-book appearances so the show didn't have to tell me much about him. Anyway, here's a list of things:

- Cad Bane brings nothing to the episode except a series of bad lines, which Corey Burton does his best to turn into gold; he doesn't manage it but he does sound fantastic, so that's cool. And I'm glad he's probably dead (although they put a *lot* of emphasis on that beeping thing on his chest)

- the big droidekas don't give off a Star Wars vibe imo; the big red eye and the all-metal look make them seem like something out of *Terminator*, even though the insectoid shape is very reminiscent of Trade Federation war machines

- it sucks that Cobb Vanth wasn't in the big battle.

- I enjoyed both of Grogu's contributions to the battle, but if I had to cut one it would definitely be when he breaks the big droid; Grogu/rancor is the friendship I didn't know I needed

- I liked the rancor a lot, particularly when it went King Kong on that tower

- Fennec Shand did upstage Boba significantly in this episode: first when she was monologuing the whole plan to Boba and Mando, and then at the end when she killed all the crime bosses single-handed. By all means give her her own show, but I think Boba should have been part of that final scene in particular.

- the Freetown/vespa gang alliance at the end was neat but it felt like we were missing some background, because city folk vs. country folk is really barebones as far as rivalries go

- Luke could not wait to get rid of Grogu, huh? Just sent him away to the worst planet he knows as soon as he possibly could.

All in all I think this finale is representative of the series: not great, a few good moments. If all those characters had been properly developed, I would have liked it a lot more.","well i enjoyed this one a lot more than episode  but i wouldnt say its a good finale it wraps things up that either werent properly set up or were only set up in the previous episode i just dont feel like ive spent enough time with these characters to fully enjoy this as a finale much as i liked the battle i dont really know the vespa gang or what they want i dont know the rancor i dont know the people of freetown all that much krrsantan is a bit more welldefined but i also read some of his comicbook appearances so the show didnt have to tell me much about him anyway heres a list of things

"228",42704,4,"/r/lotr",1,"I see people saying this a lot, that you could choose to explore the East of middle earth, but I think there would have been a greater problem there. A show like this would *never* have been made if it didn’t have a connection to the established lore. Of course it wouldn’t, what would be the pitch there? “We’re going to make an extremely expensive production which is going to be very loosely connected to LotR, and we’re going to create a whole new setting, story, even characters out of whole cloth”? Good luck with that. Casual viewers would have had very little reason to be attracted to it, and purists would have complained that they’re creating something out of whole cloth. The problem here is that aside from a couple of vague reference to the blue wizards and a couple of stray sentences here and there, we have zero context for what the East is like except that they 1. are vaguely non-white and use elephants and 2. always team up with the bad guy of the day, whether that’s Morgoth or Sauron. To me, it’s one of the more uncomfortable parts of the LotR role that Tolkien stuck all the nonwhite people in a place where they were basically never even heard of except for when they were fighting against the good guys. 

That’s my personal feelings, of course. Regardless of those, there is not a world where it would have made any kind of business or story sense to take a massive risk making a story about an underdeveloped part of the lore, especially when there’s so much to explore in the lore already. And honestly, elven skin colour is about as unimportant a detail as it comes. I’m more than okay then simply going with colour blind casting for some roles rather than trying to twist themselves into knots in order to cast nonwhite people with a justification that’s only going to please some purists (and I mean some, because while I don’t think they’re that many, there’s definitely people who just take issue to people of colour being cast at all regardless of the details).","i see people saying this a lot that you could choose to explore the east of middle earth but i think there would have been a greater problem there a show like this would never have been made if it didnt have a connection to the established lore of course it wouldnt what would be the pitch there were going to make an extremely expensive production which is going to be very loosely connected to lotr and were going to create a whole new setting story even characters out of whole cloth good luck with that casual viewers would have had very little reason to be attracted to it and purists would have complained that theyre creating something out of whole cloth the problem here is that aside from a couple of vague reference to the blue wizards and a couple of stray sentences here and there we have zero context for what the east is like except that they  are vaguely nonwhite and use elephants and  always team up with the bad guy of the day whether thats morgoth or sauron to me its one of the more uncomfortable parts of the lotr role that tolkien stuck all the nonwhite people in a place where they were basically never even heard of except for when they were fighting against the good guys

"269",50103,4,"/r/lotr",1,"This is awesome. Thanks for sharing it. Very useful to the discussion, no matter your position.

There is nothing wrong with finding a justification in the text for inclusion, if that is what you need to convince you (or you think it would help convince others). I have to ask, though. What if you couldn't find a case for it? What if we find a long lost letter from Tolkien outright rejecting the idea of black elves as preposterous?

My case isn't built on what Tolkien would have wanted, since we do not know with certainty. We know he hated apartheid. We know he thought the nazis fools for building their ideology on top of a mythic, racially pure ""[Aryan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordicism)"" identity. The work above is highly suggestive that his feelings on the matter were not that strong. But forget all that. Let's say, in his heart-of-hearts, he did not want black elves. So what?

Imagine a world where women have long beards as an immutable characteristic, were systemically enslaved, tortured, raped, slaughtered without consequence, and only recently received a form of legal (not actual economic or social) parity with their beardless brothers and sisters, and all of this horribleness “dictated” by the presence of absence of that beard. I don’t care if stories that didn’t originally feature them, produced by the dominant beardless peoples, originally had the bearded women or not. Put the bearded women in and let's stop acting like children.

We are lucky that Tolkien's story isn't contingent on the skin color of any one character. It's simply not important.

Are we really going to line up a group of actors, bust out the calipers and skin shade guide, and start measuring their ""European"" features? At one point does a children's production of a LotR story permit black and brown children to play the roles of central figures like Gandalf, but the idea then later becomes absurd when they grow up? Sorry, Timmy, you are too old and too black to play Gandalf.

Middle Earth is not history. It's not Europe. It's inhabitants aren't the ancestors of Europeans. Its locations do not map in any meaningful sense to European geography. Rhun is not fantasy Asia and Harad is not fantasy Africa (as if this lazy 1-to-1 mapping is clever world-building). The events depicted aren't discoverable through academic research, anthropology and archeology. To the extent it is European influenced is because Tolkien himself was European, and he was passionate about European myths and languages. He wrote what he knew and cared about. That's all there is to it.

Maybe, just maybe, let's leave all this nonsense behind. No one is going to rewrite the text I wouldn't want that. These are adaptations intended for modern audiences, and no matter the racial make-up of the cast, they likely would have been hated by both JRR and Christopher Tolkien for entirely different reasons.","this is awesome thanks for sharing it very useful to the discussion no matter your position

"285",41013,4,"/r/lotr",1,"Not that they exist, what I think people are complaining about is that the show-runners want to try to represent that there are significant populations of black elves and dwarves in Tolkiens story. Black people do exist in Tolkiens world, they are humans, and they live in the south region of the land known as Harad. 

It isn't so much ""politics"" as it is a ""social movement"" to change places and times in history where there wasn't any significant numbers of black people, as if having significant populations of black people was completely normal in those times and places. Basically, an attempt to rewrite history to make it more socially acceptable by modern day people. 

The show-runners even admit this when they say they decided to make Tolkiens world look like ""what the real world actually looks like"". Or in other words, they were not going to make Tolkiens world look like how he portrayed it in his own story. 

In the modern world, just about every country has a significant population of black people, except for countries where the population is dominated by a single racial group, like Japan is still 95% Japanese I believe, same goes for Italy being 95% Italian, and a few other countries. Not to mention many African countries which are 95% black, or China which is more than 95% asian. Homogeneous nations exist all over the world, even today, not every country is a melting pot. 

Tolkiens world, to the best of our knowledge, the lands where the stories of the Hobbit and LOTR take place, the population was 95% white, just like England was 8000 years ago, which was the English setting that he based his story on, except that the population was made up of Humans, Elves, Dwarves, and Hobbits. The other 5%, the black population, were humans, and came from the south.

If you watched the OP video, you'll see that PJ says that what Tolkien wanted to do was to create a ""mythology for England"". An England that ""might have existed 8000 years ago"". If that was the authors intention, then anyone who adapts his story should respect that and keep their ""social causes"" out of the picture. That is what PJ tried to do, and even though he made changes, his films are considered by many to be masterpieces. These show-runners aren't respecting that, and that's why the fans are upset. 

This is supposed to be English mythology from 8000 years ago, not a contemporary English society.","not that they exist what i think people are complaining about is that the showrunners want to try to represent that there are significant populations of black elves and dwarves in tolkiens story black people do exist in tolkiens world they are humans and they live in the south region of the land known as harad 

it isnt so much politics as it is a social movement to change places and times in history where there wasnt any significant numbers of black people as if having significant populations of black people was completely normal in those times and places basically an attempt to rewrite history to make it more socially acceptable by modern day people 

the showrunners even admit this when they say they decided to make tolkiens world look like what the real world actually looks like or in other words they were not going to make tolkiens world look like how he portrayed it in his own story 

in the modern world just about every country has a significant population of black people except for countries where the population is dominated by a single racial group like japan is still  japanese i believe same goes for italy being  italian and a few other countries not to mention many african countries which are  black or china which is more than  asian homogeneous nations exist all over the world even today not every country is a melting pot 

tolkiens world to the best of our knowledge the lands where the stories of the hobbit and lotr take place the population was  white just like england was  years ago which was the english setting that he based his story on except that the population was made up of humans elves dwarves and hobbits the other  the black population were humans and came from the south

if you watched the op video youll see that pj says that what tolkien wanted to do was to create a mythology for england an england that might have existed  years ago if that was the authors intention then anyone who adapts his story should respect that and keep their social causes out of the picture that is what pj tried to do and even though he made changes his films are considered by many to be masterpieces these showrunners arent respecting that and thats why the fans are upset

"301",40487,4,"/r/lotr",1,"I remember reading something around when the movies first came out in theaters that after PJ took over after GDT, they were in post-production and almost done with everything in two films instead of 3. But then the studio came in told them to make it 3 movies that were about 3 hours long just like the LotR trilogy. So they had to go back and add in a ton of shit and that's basically how Desolation of Smaug came about. I think some of the extra stuff ended up in UJ and BotFA, but it was mostly all DoS to be able to stretch to the 3 movies.

Also, iirc they screwed over Evangeline Lilly, too. Supposedly, she would only sign on to do the movie if her character wasn't put in a love triangle. She didn't want to do anything like that again after Lost and possibly be type-cast as the chick always caught in a love triangle with two other dudes. They agreed they wouldn't do that, she signed on, they started filming and everything was fine.

And then the studio came in. 

They wanted a love triangle between the new, hot female elf, the hot elf guy that everyone remembers from before and who gained a crazy amount of popularity from that same role, and the new, hot, young dwarf guy that was sure to be the next Orlando Bloom/Legolas of the Hobbit trilogy (ok, those descriptions were my own, obvs, but after hearing that, that's what I can only imagine the studio was thinking when they told them to do that).

I wish I could remember where I read about all this. Again it was several years ago now, and it's all just memory now, but I think about it every time I watch the Hobbit trilogy.

I know that it’s for all the fans that go “awwww” every time he comes on screen, I’m just not one of those but that’s a personal problem.

The overall craftsmanship of this episode was terrible. I literally don’t understand how that happened when Star Wars is known for that above all else. The art direction, the CGI, and even the makeup and prosthetics were all such a let down. Idk what happened here but either Disney didn’t give them enough money, or the people behind the show had no idea how to use it.

And the directing was non-existent. It truly felt like there was just people in rooms talking, not really to each other, but just talking. And this is amplified in all the action scenes. When the Rancor finally comes out, the camera cuts to citizens slowly crouching down, as if they didn’t just see a giant monster climb a wall towards them. Same thing happened when the Rancor started fighting the giant robot. Everyone was just sort of standing there. Like the actors weren’t at all sure what they were reacting to. Or when the kid street gang comes in, the female one revs her bike and literally her speed doesn’t change… There was absolutely no care brought into this show for the little details and it’s so disappointing.

It didn’t know if it wanted to tell the story of how Boba survived after almost getting eaten, or if it wanted to tell the story of him taking control of Mos Espa, or if it wanted to continue The Mandalorian’s story. 

Even now we have no clear idea what Fett’s motivations are. Cade Bane asks him and he just says “these are my people” as if he didn’t spend years essentially terrorizing them and working for their oppressors with no qualms about it. We are just expected to go along for the ride, one with no clear goal or end. And nothing even comes out of it in the end. Boba wins and… that’s it. He just gains control after the worlds longest and worst shootout 

Boba Fett, as written, is just a terrible character. No motivation, no drive, zero sense of urgency, zero understanding of the world, a massive fucking pushover, and just an old man. There was a total of 0 moments in this show that made me like him, sympathize with him, or even just find him cool/entertaining. Honestly Fenec carried the show as her character is the only interesting one, but even then she’s entirely flat with zero depth to her, she just happens to be badass and far more likable than Boba.

This doesn’t even mention that terrible use of fan service. Cade Bane just coming out just to shot two people and say some words before being killed? Like what’s even the point of his character. He contributed absolutely *nothing*. Literally any character could have been there. What a fucking waste and it shows that the writers and Disney care more about appealing to the stans then create real art or at least telling a decent story.

At least the music was good though.

2/5 stars for the entire series.","this is gonna be unpopular on this subreddit but jesus christ what a terrible finale

the overall craftsmanship of this episode was terrible i literally dont understand how that happened when star wars is known for that above all else the art direction the cgi and even the makeup and prosthetics were all such a let down idk what happened here but either disney didnt give them enough money or the people behind the show had no idea how to use it

and the directing was nonexistent it truly felt like there was just people in rooms talking not really to each other but just talking and this is lified in all the action scenes when the rancor finally comes out the camera cuts to citizens slowly crouching down as if they didnt just see a giant monster climb a wall towards them same thing happened when the rancor started fighting the giant robot everyone was just sort of standing there like the actors werent at all sure what they were reacting to or when the kid street gang comes in the female one revs her bike and literally her speed doesnt change there was absolutely no care brought into this show for the little details and its so disappointing

"323",41664,4,"/r/lotr",1,"TLDR - Norse mythology and Celtic mythology is probably most close to what pre-Norman, pre-christian, Anglo-Saxon Mythology would have been like. Tolkien actually translated a copy of *Beowulf*, which is an old English epic written in the 9-10th century, just before the Norman Conquest (1066). Although, even Beowulf is set in pagan 6th century Scandanavia, so even it is a little too pre-Christian/pre-English to be accurate. It is considered one of the most important work of Old-English Literature and *heavily* influenced Tolkien's stories.

Also, I like the show The Last Kingdom, which, though mostly fictional, is set in historic pre-Norman England
 
Ramble:

It's interesting right? I was also pretty surprised to hear about how England has no 'mythology' perse.

You've probably heard that English is a 'Germanic' language. This was always weird to me, cuz England and Germany seem so distinct and sort of culturally distant. But lenguistically, they're similar. The Germanic language family includes Scandanavian, English, Dutch, and German-speaking regions. 

And this is because, after the fall of the Roman empire, Germanic peoples (proto-vikings) began spreading to the British isles, setting up colonies and intermingling with the local Gaelic/roman population. Angles (from where we get 'Anglo' or 'England') actually hailed from modern-day Denmark. Saxons (the second part of Anglo-Saxon) hailed from modern-day Northern Germany (Schleswig-Holstein). So English developed from this mix of language and peoples, as did a unique hybrid culture (which Tolkien considered authentically English) that was basically destroyed when the Normans invaded.

And another thing about Tolkien, this interplay between languages/people's/cultures is basically why he invented Middle Earth, to create languages which stem from the historic clashes and unions of different people's throughout time. He considered real-world examples like Anglo-Saxons when envisioning how his imaginary world's history developed. The Rohirrim are basically Anglo-Saxons (if only they had horses, the one thing the Normans used to defeat them!)

So getting to the end of my ramble, pre-Norman Pagan Mythology would likely have been akin to Norse Mythology mixed with Gaelic Mythology. Something that Tolkien emulated all the time in his work: Elves, Dwarves, Trolls, Ents, Orcs, Gandalf appears in the form of an old man similar to Norse myths of Odin, Eru Illuvitar is a play on the Norse term 'all-father', the king of the Gods.","tldr  norse mythology and celtic mythology is probably most close to what prenorman prechristian anglosaxon mythology would have been like tolkien actually translated a copy of beowulf which is an old english epic written in the th century just before the norman conquest  although even beowulf is set in pagan th century scandanavia so even it is a little too prechristianpreenglish to be accurate it is considered one of the most important work of oldenglish literature and heavily influenced tolkiens stories

This subject, in my experience, has always ended up with masks slipping and beliefs of ethnonationalism and racialism coming out in their justifications. 


Beauty standards and age are something commonly discussed in the arts, you're right. Coincidentally I just posted how a portrayal of Luthien would be interesting given we all have subjective standards of beauty, but obviously the producer of the respective work will make their own decision. Also how people considered Cate's casting incorrect because she's ugly. These kinds of issues are, however, aren't comparable with race as aforementioned. 

My position is what is actually the most important part of Tolkien's stories? Pigmentation or the actual events of the world in which peoples of different races come together to end evil while lamenting the loss of nature in the name of 'progress'? I don't think skin colour is that valuable here, nor would I feel Tolkien himself would argue that either given his condemnation of such attempts of claiming language and literature in such a way. 

He himself has shown to be contradictory between his letters, drafts and published work. He'll decide one thing in one draft but then answer his thoughts as something else in a letter years down the line. It suggests to me superficial things like that weren't that necessarily important to him and so if it wasn't for him, why would it be for me and use his name in vain. Surely to maintain the significant aspects of said work would be most important in keeping high fidelity(faithfulness). There is a good paper that explores the value of fidelity in adaptations and if I can find it I'll share it here. It's a very interesting exploration as a philosophical topic.","it can be reasonable but the gatekeeping of race is problematic because race has been a real sociopolitical issue in which vast groups of people have been oppressed excludedrelevantly from the performing arts and had other atrocities lain upon them this subject in my experience has always ended up with masks slipping and beliefs of ethnonationalism and racialism coming out in their justifications

The Actor is not black skinned.
He is brown or ""Latino Tan"". The lighting in the scene does not show this to the full extent but look up Ismael Cruz Cordova. Is that Black to you or is hair your means of defining a persons skin color?

I would consider these actors to be Black:
Chadwick Boseman. (Black panther)
Eddie Murphy, kevin Hart, Jamie fox or even the Dwarven Princess Disa they are rightfully black, Bill Cosby, and I can go on. There are clear visible differences in the tone of their skin.

"346",29962,4,"/r/lotr",1,"The show is embellishing on themes that were already established in the texts. Galadriel is described by Tolkien as the physical and mental equal of any of the male Noldor princes, as well as a warrior and leader of her people. It’s not the only interpretation that could be made, but there is plenty of textual support for depicting Galadriel as a warrior. The ‘young and hotheaded’ description of Second Age Galadriel I do take issue with, however.

As a woman and a Tolkien fan, it’s really disheartening and sad to see these revisionist (and uninformed) claims that it’s sooooo unrealistic for Galadriel to be a warrior, often with highly misogynistic comments about women being physically inferior to men thrown in.","the show is embellishing on themes that were already established in the texts galadriel is described by tolkien as the physical and mental equal of any of the male noldor princes as well as a warrior and leader of her people its not the only interpretation that could be made but there is plenty of textual support for depicting galadriel as a warrior the young and hotheaded description of second age galadriel i do take issue with however

"357",4419,4,"/r/StarWars",0,"Ugh. So many cheesy moments from this episode. Horrible acting from both of the power ranger main characters, battles that make zero sense?

The power ranger characters are both horrible actors. I’m sorry, it’s just the truth. They are stiff, their lines are corny, and they look like they’re from a youtube fan film. I’m sure some of it is out of their control, but the girl is such a horrible actor. I really was excited for her at the least cause I think her look individually is sick, but it’s actually hard to watch IMO. 

I hate when characters spin for no reason, it’s horrible fight scene choreography. 

How did the lady bringing Grogu not hear the blaster fire and explosions as she was pulling up? She just strolls into the scene and is “surprised” by it. 

Why did they go up to the roof? Did they think that the giant droids shield had a softspot like a baby’s head? The only reason it worked was because Boba came in with the Rancor, which they didn’t know was going to happen.

Why does the droid walk at 1mph, but suddenly once Mando is on the cart the droid can run at 50mph?

Why did Grogu destroy the droid pulling them on the cart? It felt to me like the writers needed them to fly off the cart, and just Grogu-ex machina’d it (Maybe I’m missing something?)

Why is everyone running in slow motion, and the droids are comedically missing the entire crowd of people? Why are they running in a straight line through the widest street in Mos Espa? If they walk through any alleyway, the droid can’t get through. 

Why did Boba make a big deal about the droids destroying the city, but then he brings out the Rancor and does even more damage than the droids did?

Does anyone think that the Twi’lek guy is still funny? I’m so sick of his “fish out water, I use my wits to survive” act. Like it was a good bit for him to go out and read the fake surrender treaty, but then he went on for like 15 seconds about stupid bullshit. THEN he had a gun aimed directly at him and I was SO excited for him to die, and Boba+Mando save his life. 

There are so many things that just make no sense at all in this episode. It completely took me out of it and was just god awful writing. I’m not one to nitpick plot holes but those droids were like the strongest thing on earth one scene, then Original trilogy storm trooper bad in the next scene.

"393",14144,4,"/r/StarWars",0,"* the big droids can't keep up with people running on foot, but can keep up with the rickshaw which can go fast enough to cause a dramatic car crash. 
* Boba has no agency in his own show, everything he does is something someone else told him to do, or someone else doing it for him
* You could edit out every cad bane scene and it doesn't change the story at all. That character has no narrative point. Bad writing.
* so the wookie, right? gets shot like 30 times, has a broken foot halfway twisted off. So he just sits down for like 5 minutes and then he's just fine? Furthermore, why did all those trandoshans pull out knives? I mean literally why? They swarm and pin the wookie, with knives, and nobody stabs him? Going out like ceasar would have been a badass end for the wookie. But again, since nobody is ever in danger and there's no dramatic tension, the swarm of angry mob with knives that successfully tackles and swamps the character just . . . doesn't . . . actually do anything.
* ""the people of mos espa need me"". Then for the love of god show them. Not one single person from mos espa showed up. The mod gang doesn't count, they are being paid. The only civilians that show up are the hicks from out of town. If you try to write a character as a noble defender of the people you need to show your audience that the people need defending. The show does not do that. Actually the show does the opposite of that, with the Pykes repeatedly saying ""just leave us alone and we will leave you alone"", to which Boba takes it upon himself to have a literal war in the middle of town. And then declares himself a defender of the people. That is a villain move. What is this show doing?
* So the giant blaster droid can blow up an armed and armored combat vehicle (the speeder) but it can't blow up a mud wall. Got it. It's strong enough to be thrown through a building, but it's not going to just walk up and smash the little wall. This is bad because it takes what is supposed to be the biggest threat, and makes it not a threat.
* So the rancor is gonna eat one guy whole but the next guy he's just going to take a lil' dainty bite of his head. This doesn't make narrative sense.
* why did we do the checkov's beskar chain mail thing? Why did we do a whole montage of building mando's new jet? Neither of these things are important or used in any way. We are shown and told they are important, but then they aren't even used.
* if you want to build dramatic tension you have to show that danger is dangerous. Nobody important is ever in danger. The pykes either have terrible accuracy or absolutely incredible accuracy with their ability to only hit very specifically armored parts of mando/boba. We see the pykes pin down the mod gang but then Fennec just casually kills them. So the bad guys are dangerous, then they aren't, then they are, then they aren't. The whole fight sequence is very inconsistent with this.
* why did we have this whole big war when Fennec can just assassinate the leadership that easily? This really jars with Boba's self-appointed protector of the people message. He could have just gotten rid of the pykes quietly but instead decides to put the entire town in danger with a massive shootout that destroys a bunch of the city. But then says he's doing it for the people. If I believed the writers knew what they were doing I would say that's sociopathic, narcissistic behavior. Unfortunately it's just another example of Boba, the main character, being a passive part of the scenery in his own show. So is Boba Fett a badass? We see him in shootouts, we see him stand up to Bane, we see him ride a rancor. Badass, right? We also see him fail to come up with a plan, we see him constantly change his mind. We see him make stupid choices (why use cover or rooftops when we could just stand in the middle of the open and get shot a bunch?). We see other characters doing his work for him (Boba didn't take out the pykes, Fennec did). So which is it, show? What are you telling me, writers? Nobody can make up their mind.
* so cad bane is faster than boba. We hear Bane say that he is faster. We see that he is faster when he out draws Boba. Then he is not faster. Apparently Boba can pull a stick off his back and smack someone with it while laying on his back faster than he can point a gun that is already in his hands. If you did this in a movie making 101 class the teacher would rip into you for it, which would be good because it breaks internal consistency and it removes any dramatic tension. It also robs the death of a supposed big bad guy of any weight, because Boba doesn't have to do anything special to win. A good villain should force the main character to have to do something risky or unusual, should force some sort of growth from the main character. Instead all we get is that Cad Bane is fast, he's faster than the marshall, he's faster than Boba. Then he isn't faster than Boba.
* good thing we had that big emotional ending to mando season 2 oh wait I guess in an episode of a spinoff show we're going to undo that whole thing. Again, it's the cad bane problem. If you cut every Luke/jedi scene out of the show, the plot doesn't change at all.
* ok so we're going to give mando and boba this really badass scene where they are fighting together and it's going to look awesome and oh also it's going to change nothing and accomplish nothing because remember, Boba can't actually do anything useful in his own show.


So yeah, just a few notes. I might get around to watching it again and working up a proper critique but at this point I just feel apathetic. The show was a thing, it wasn't done very well, and now it's over. Meh.

"426",39892,4,"/r/lotr",1,"It’s relevant as a point of comparison based on the nature of Tolkien’s objections and how they apply to PJs version of LOTR as well as the Amazon series. Tolkien was more concerned with missing significant thematic elements than just missing plot points. That’s why he would prefer to leave out Helms Deep (a battle between men) in favor of the Ents battling Saruman (a battle of trees against industrialization). The danger of industrialization was a major theme of the books. To his credit, PJ included both. 

Looking at another theme that PJ got horribly wrong, Tolkien would almost certainly want the battle of Pelennor Fields shortened in favor of including the Scouring. I understand why the Scouring was cut, and it makes sense for a movie, but it’s critical to the book because it demonstrates the development of the hobbits into leaders and also demonstrates that no one escapes the impact of war. In the movie, the residents of the Shire appear to be entirely oblivious to what happened. Tolkien would have been horrified.

Now look at ROP. If the reported terms of the agreement are accurate, Amazon is prohibited from changing written canon in the material they have access to and they cannot change the nature or themes of the story when making additions.

I’ll grant that Amazon may be pushing the limits of the agreement, but they are far more constrained than PJ was. The time compression in particular has a high risk of misrepresenting important events. So the letter is relevant to any adaptation, but I don’t think it’s useful to apply to a single adaptation without also pointing out how the others went wrong. It creates the impression that Amazon could produce something that would satisfy Tolkien, when the reality is, based on every other adaptation, that they probably can’t.","its relevant as a point of comparison based on the nature of tolkiens objections and how they apply to pjs version of lotr as well as the amazon series tolkien was more concerned with missing significant thematic elements than just missing plot points thats why he would prefer to leave out helms deep a battle between men in favor of the ents battling saruman a battle of trees against industrialization the danger of industrialization was a major theme of the books to his credit pj included both

Do I expect a man nearly 80 years old to remember every detail of every character for something as massive as his books were? No. That’s why there are such inconsistencies.

Him identifying male dwarves doesn’t discredit his clearly stated vision of them in the books or he would need to have said except women. He probably forgot about Cirdan or it didn’t come to his mind at that time of writing this. 

As for Aragorn and the rest, this letter, while by him, is his opinion and that opinion was probably back and forth that is why it wasn’t in the books. Much of his works changed back and forth, so while we can say yes, he would have liked to see them beardless, it wasn’t something in the books because it wasn’t important enough for him to focus in on it and the movies are okay with stubbles Aragorn.

as for aragorn and the rest this letter while by him is his opinion and that opinion was probably back and forth that is why it wasnt in the books much of his works changed back and forth so while we can say yes he would have liked to see them beardless it wasnt something in the books because it wasnt important enough for him to focus in on it and the movies are okay with stubbles aragorn that doesnt apply to every matter of the books

Strange, really, given the assassination of his character in the movies. I guess McKellen's Gandalf is close enough to my pre-existing head cannon that the two are interchangeable.

Aragorn, in particular, I visualise very differently to Viggo Mortensen. In my head, Aragorn is taller, darker, a little more gaunt and travel-worn - and with a far deeper voice. He looks a bit like a younger Rick Okasek, actually. In my head, the hobbits look more like their cartoon depictions in the Bakshi movie - more pre-disposed to being a bit on the rounder side, as described in the books. In that regard, Movie Sam is definitely the closest to the image in my head for any of the hobbits, but still too youthful looking for a gardener who has worked outdoors for years for my liking.

Since someone has mentioned the movies that should not be spoken of, the dwarves in those movies don't resemble my dwarves, or dwarves as described by Tolkien, in the slightest: in the movies, they just look like either slightly eccentric men or gnomes, definitely not dwarves.","off hand i cant think of a single character except perhaps gimli where i visualise the movie character when i read the books strange really given the assassination of his character in the movies i guess mckellens gandalf is close enough to my preexisting head cannon that the two are interchangeable

"518",41963,4,"/r/lotr",1,"Oh yeah, well that's down to, effectively, an Alt-Right problem.

There are absolutely legit grievances to be had with the casting of black people for this show. It *does* go against ""the loooore"" and it isn't accurate. However, it is relevant and if there's a black elf that somehow makes a black kid grin from ear to ear, because it feels represented by the character, then that is a thousand times more valuable on a social level than some dusty adherence to ""the source"". LotR isn't LotR, because white people frollick around. LotR is LotR, because the themes and the stories have moved generations.

However, at the end of the day we are (online at least) deeply entrenched in a cultural war these days. It's no secret that the Alt-Right and literal Nazis spent years infiltrating ""white nerdy boy"" hobbies in the past decade. That's how we got ""Gamer Gate"" and the whole ""A WOMAN IN MY GAME? THIS IS POLITICAL! FEMALES ARE INFERIOR TO MEN!"" nonsense.

This same shit happened to Star Wars a few years ago when ""The Last Jedi"" was.... controversial among fans for very legit reasons (deconstructing the formula for no good reason, etc.) and allllll of the blame was pushed on the casting choices and ""go woke, go broke"" became the slogan.

I expect this to happen again, if RoP actually turns out to suck. Criticism won't boil down to story structure, plotholes or whatever else, but it'll focus on ""girlboss Galadriel"" and black characters.

In the end, it's the same shit that happens IRL. People see the issues of the modern world, low wages, homelessness, crime statistics skyrocketing, loneliness, etc. and instead of correctly identifying the real issue (here Capitalism), they listen to shysters and hucksters who proclaim that the problem are brown people, or women, or people with different sexualities. 

What you see here is a repeat of what happened with a lot of franchises over the past few years. The only major difference right now is that the show hasn't been out yet, but we've seen enough subpar, overhyped fantasy shows (looking at Witcher and WoT) to make educated guesses.

I full on expect this show to be kind of shit, but it will have nothing to do with the choice to make some elves black or whatever. It'll simply come down to delusional writers or something like that. After all, a good story is a good story, regardless of what the skin colour of a character is and LotR never really gave a fuck about skin colour. It was always just an implied thing, because Tolkien grew up in a certain era.","oh yeah well thats down to effectively an altright problem

I think the Clone Wars does a really great job of displaying just how bad things had gotten.  You're basically watching the Jedi Order fall in real-time, and it's the first domino to go.  Obi-Wan might be the only Jedi in the entire series that sticks with the idea of being a Jedi.  Mace Windu, Yoda, and plenty of other masters start to bend to the pressure of the senate/military too often and when the Jedi finally remember, ""Oh, right, we're supposed to defend democracy,"" it's already too late.

The fact you know what's going to happen makes the show's depressing nature all the more necessary.  I think that's what I like best about it.  It's telling the story of what happened to the Republic, and Anakin especially, before RotS, because if you just watch RotS, it isn't really clear how Anakin could go on to do what he did.  But watching the Clone Wars you see him watch, almost helplessly, as his world crumbles.  He had some dark-side tendencies already, sure, but the anger is only part of it.  The disillusionment of the Jedi is also part of it, and his inability to control his emotion is another.

It's very easy to fudge numbers and proclaim that your show is ""the Number #1 New Show"" by some really obscure metric, like weekly streaming demands on your own streaming website, as opposed to comparisons with others. 

In terms of the actual signs that a show has made an impact, though? I haven't seen *anyone* talking about Wheel of Time outside of the very eclectic circles online where it was already hyped up. I'm certain that a decent number of people watched the show. But none of them were talking about it at the level of *Game of Thrones*, ever. Not even half that. Season 1 ended, and outside of the Wheel of Time subreddits, I've seen almost zero threads about it on this site. I haven't seen a single mainstream meme utilizing an image from the show. It hasn't penetrated into the culture.

Now, LOTR will have an inherently larger appeal, but even then, if you're looking at success purely in *financial* terms, you're sort of missing the whole point of my comment. Many, many films and TV Shows have been financially successful and also poorly written. Look at the Star Wars Sequels. Maybe you can give Force Awakens and Last Jedi a pass, but I've never seen anyone honestly try to defend The Rise of Skywalker as anything more than a flaming pile of garbage. And that movie *still* made over a billion dollars, simply because it was Star Wars, not because it was good...

I'm not measuring this show's success by how much money it makes, and I don't think anyone here is. We didn't judge the Peter Jackson films that way, and if they had been exactly the same, but bombed in theaters, I think we'd still say they were good.

They don't even blow up the ship just in case? When Chewie gets captured there's a second ship in the background - this is apparently the ship Rey blows up. However minus that tiny clip, there is no second ship. Finn has a view of Chewie getting captured and sees the ship flying away. He lets Rey know he's on the ship and they're kidnapping him. Yet somehow, out of two ships, he got confused? And then the other ship (apparently with Chewie on it) just disappears. And with that thinking, who *did* Rey end up killing?

Chewie aside nothing else in this scene makes any sense. What is Kylo doing? Why is he going to run over Rey? Why would Kylo want to kill Rey when apparently he has feelings for her? If he DID want to kill Rey, why not shoot her with lasers? Why is Rey running away from the ship when she can do her flip from standing still? Why wouldn't she just toss her lightsaber at the wing? How does Kylo survive blowing up at 300mph? Why doesn't Kylo blow up the Sith ship *first* and then worry about Rey? It's legitimately the only way they can escape.

There are so so soooooooo many things wrong in that span of 15 or so minutes in that movie that make no sense at all. The beginning of the movie where they get plans makes zero sense too.

"547",29494,4,"/r/lotr",1,">Visigoths  [...] were originally from maybe somewhere between modern day Ukraine to to modern day Kazakhstan.

There's a few things wrong with that statement. 

The question of where the Goths came from isn't entirely clear, but archaeology suggests that these came from a group on the southern part of the Baltic around the present day towns of Gdańsk and Chełmno and were the source or part of the Wielbark culture. There a question of whether these people originated in southern Sweden from either Götaland or Gotland via the Gutones, but that is heavily argued and far from settled.

The Visigoths tend to be more associated with the Thervingi that lived between the Dneiper and Lower Danube, in what is mostly today Romania and Moldavia. Whilst Jordanes isn't the best source, he links Alaric with the earlier Thervingi king Athanaric which meshes with the Goths settled in the area that he came from within the empire being the same as that settled by the Thervingi.

However this is largely an inaccurate way to conceptualise the Visigoths. Since the Gothic war in 376, previous ethno-cultural identities that the migrating Goths had were worn away and reforged anew with the treaty 418 granting them hospitalitas in Aquitania. During that gap the mixed group of Greuthungi, Thervingi and Alans that migrated across the Danube lost their previous tribal identities and were lumped under the term Goth along with the deserters and slaves that had joined them during the Gothic war. Alaric and his followers who hailed from this group took on more outsiders with the invasion of Italy with the desertion of the 'barbarian' soldiers after their families had been massacred following Stilicho's execution. This group then saw further mixing with the Gallo Romans of Aquitania following their settling there. Effectively during this time the group that had migrated over the river some 42 years ago had changed significantly in composition and had become heavily Romanised such that only a whittled core of what was still remained the same and were in effect a new people.","visigoths   were originally from maybe somewhere between modern day ukraine to to modern day kazakhstan

Not much good to say, but I did love that we got to see the kneepad rocket-dart launchers in action. I think everything with the Rancor looked amazing. The Mando/Boba team-up was decent and disregarding some strange editing choices I enjoyed the way Boba ultimately defeated Cad Bane.

Ignoring the context, I did appreciate seeing the rickshaw droid again, that was one of my favourite prequel designs. I was surprised that they were able to make the ending fairly cohesive considering the lengthy detour that we just experienced.

I know I never got to the extended write-up I promised last week - I was just too depressed about the state of the show. I'd like to do an in-depth season analysis, but I think I'm still too sad about how this all went off the rails. It just seems like a tragic waste of resources and potential - it showed flashes of brilliance but ultimately failed more than it succeeded. At the very least I can give it more credit than the sequels - when it went down in flames it wasn't due to indifference or malice, I think the creatives had a lot of heart, they just generally didn't know what they were doing a lot of the times and don't have a lot of storytelling talent. (I'm not quite sure about Filoni though - sometimes it seems like his goal is to just put in as many of his characters as he can.) Anyway, I'm sad that they didn't bother to tell an arc or do any character development with Boba Fett.We still have no clue as to his motivations. In some ways the canonical version is a lot worse than what we had before. It's also a shame they spent so much times on detours and pointless side characters that the conclusion felt so pathetic. It genuinely feels like they got bored of the character halfway through and just decided to return to the story they like better (and even when they did so, a lot of it was just retreading things we've already seen).

I wasn't impressed by Rodriguez's first showing when he directed ""The Tragedy"" back in season 2 of the Mandalorian, but somehow people seemed to love that episode and even had it as their favorite. When I heard Rodriguez was going to be involved in this I was not thrilled. For the most part I'd say my worries were justified. This show had some of the best Star Wars I've ever seen, but unfortunate none of those moments had anything to do with Boba Fett. I think this show could have done a thousand times better in different hands. As a whole this show fails. And the worst of it seems to be due to Rodriguez's style. I really hope that he doesn’t get to direct any future star wars and that the Mandalorian can be untouched by the unfortunate mistakes of this show. It is a shame that Din and Grogus meaningful reunion had to be stuffed into this show. This should have only been about Boba and it should have been directed my someone else. It also would have helped if the story was more interesting. Watching Boba form a relationship with the Tuskens was the most solid part of this show. Everything else with Boba was unfortunately very slow and uninteresting. The Pykes were not intimidating enough and not nearly as cool as Cad Bane who was shoved into the last two episodes of the show. The best way to describe this show is to say that it is a mess. This show hurt Boba Fett more then it helped him and that's probably what makes it even harder for me to swallow. Everything with Boba as a whole is unfortunately 4/10 stars for me. The episodes where we focused only on Din and Grogu are easily an 8/10, but the fact that they are in this show makes them weaker in my eyes. I don't think I'll be excited to watch this show again except for certain episodes. A real shame.","it was ok theres a lot of problem with the show and overall im left more disappointed than enthralled i wasnt impressed by rodriguezs first showing when he directed the tragedy back in season  of the mandalorian but somehow people seemed to love that episode and even had it as their favorite when i heard rodriguez was going to be involved in this i was not thrilled for the most part id say my worries were justified this show had some of the best star wars ive ever seen but unfortunate none of those moments had anything to do with boba fett i think this show could have done a thousand times better in different hands as a whole this show fails and the worst of it seems to be due to rodriguezs style i really hope that he doesnt get to direct any future star wars and that the mandalorian can be untouched by the unfortunate mistakes of this show it is a shame that din and grogus meaningful reunion had to be stuffed into this show this should have only been about boba and it should have been directed my someone else it also would have helped if the story was more interesting watching boba form a relationship with the tuskens was the most solid part of this show everything else with boba was unfortunately very slow and uninteresting the pykes were not intimidating enough and not nearly as cool as cad bane who was shoved into the last two episodes of the show the best way to describe this show is to say that it is a mess this show hurt boba fett more then it helped him and thats probably what makes it even harder for me to swallow everything with boba as a whole is unfortunately  stars for me the episodes where we focused only on din and grogu are easily an  but the fact that they are in this show makes them weaker in my eyes i dont think ill be excited to watch this show again except for certain episodes a real shame"

"679",9067,4,"/r/StarWars",0,"1. Shooting the droids with anything apparently makes them swivel to a new target, allowing adequate time for people to slowly jog away. I am almost positive there is no way for Bane to shoot Boba out of the Slave I pilot seat eithier.

2. Slave I is an iconic spaceship that can never have enough screentime, and as you said, no armor rancor is kinda dumb, but Boba is supposed to be smart. If they wanted the Rancor, Boba shoulda rode it into Mos Espa to begin with as a show of force. How much time did he waste riding a rancor back to town instead of just bringing in Slave I? How many extra people died because he wanted a more epic fight?

3. Firespray class gunships - as told - are fighters and I guess they don't really care, if they can eat what they are fighting (I mean it literally blew away all the nikto bikers and sand worms instead of eating them all).

4. And this is kinda the best reason, if you disagree with the rest. Boba could not jave possibly known two droids were the last thing the pikes had. All episode Boba gets surprised. Boba thinks he he has a pact with rival lords? SURPRISE! Boba thinks he can't be flanked? Ohh yeah there's a surprise. Boba thinks the pikes numbers are smaller then they turn out to be? Surprise again! Boba thinks freetown isn't coming? Ha! SURPRISE! Boba thinks they rannoff the pikes, onlu to find out they have walking tank droids with super shields? Yeah... surprise... boba thinks fire will work! Fire no work. Surprised. Boba thinks bring rancor to fight is a good idea, and everyone will appreciate it. Surprise! Villagers try to kill rampaging monster because it is a wild animal just wreaking havok. Tries to eat mando because it has no chill. Bad form Boba.

Exactly when did Boba show off his amazing tactical abilities? Pikes have access to ships, which is half the reason he had piggies at the spaceport, who died thanks to Boba's martial prowess. What if the droids weren't the last wave? What if next the pikes just firebombed the whole city from the air? You know what woulda been helpful against both droids and ships? 

Was the rancor cool? Sure. Should it have been part of the finale? Absolutely. Chekov's rancor. But should Boba have flown off mid fight, with no announced plan, just to show up on a rancor instead of in a gunship? Fuck no. 
 
The best tool a rancor has is the fact it is a bonafide monster. If Boba had planned for the rancor to be used early on againat squishy scared meatmen, then yeah, good plan. And rancor could still fight some droids. Villagers would see rancor maybe not such a bad guy. But to just run off with the promise he would be back later midfight, only to show up riding the worst option in his palace is dumb. Just dumb. Spinny vespa guy shooting style dumb.","shooting the droids with anything apparently makes them swivel to a new target allowing adequate time for people to slowly jog away i am almost positive there is no way for bane to shoot boba out of the slave i pilot seat eithier

 slave i is an iconic spaceship that can never have enough screentime and as you said no armor rancor is kinda dumb but boba is supposed to be smart if they wanted the rancor boba shoulda rode it into mos espa to begin with as a show of force how much time did he waste riding a rancor back to town instead of just bringing in slave i how many extra people died because he wanted a more epic fight

 firespray class gunships  as told  are fighters and i guess they dont really care if they can eat what they are fighting i mean it literally blew away all the nikto bikers and sand worms instead of eating them all

 and this is kinda the best reason if you disagree with the rest boba could not jave possibly known two droids were the last thing the pikes had all episode boba gets surprised boba thinks he he has a pact with rival lords surprise boba thinks he cant be flanked ohh yeah theres a surprise boba thinks the pikes numbers are smaller then they turn out to be surprise again boba thinks freetown isnt coming ha surprise boba thinks they rannoff the pikes onlu to find out they have walking tank droids with super shields yeah surprise boba thinks fire will work fire no work surprised boba thinks bring rancor to fight is a good idea and everyone will appreciate it surprise villagers try to kill raging monster because it is a wild animal just wreaking havok tries to eat mando because it has no chill bad form boba

exactly when did boba show off his amazing tactical abilities pikes have access to ships which is half the reason he had piggies at the spaceport who died thanks to bobas martial prowess what if the droids werent the last wave what if next the pikes just firebombed the whole city from the air you know what woulda been helpful against both droids and ships 

was the rancor cool sure should it have been part of the finale absolutely chekovs rancor but should boba have flown off mid fight with no announced plan just to show up on a rancor instead of in a gunship fuck no 
 
the best tool a rancor has is the fact it is a bonafide monster if boba had planned for the rancor to be used early on againat squishy scared meatmen then yeah good plan and rancor could still fight some droids villagers would see rancor maybe not such a bad guy but to just run off with the promise he would be back later midfight only to show up riding the worst option in his palace is dumb just dumb spinny vespa guy shooting style dumb"

"698",13649,4,"/r/StarWars",0,"This show is just flashing lights and explosions. Yeah, it's dumb fun and works on that level. My monkey brain does go crazy for a second when I see an old character pop up, or when things go boom. But the moment I stop to think about it, nothings adds up.

I never really got Boba's transition from cold blooded bounty hunter to... crime lord/governor of a city. I didn't get why he was so naïve as to how to run his crime empire/city. He has to be told repeatedly by other characters that maybe he needs muscle.... that money can buy muscle... that he needs influence... but all he does is walk from the town to his palace wondering why nobody respects him. He makes a truce with other crime families and just expects them to not betray him. He bets his life on this. The same Boba Fett who grew up in the middle of war, who bounty hunted with the best for decades, that was so badass he could talk back to Vader.

I get that Boba's time with the Tuskens supposedly changed him. But the time passed is unclear (I think it's five years?) and poorly depicted. Also... he was initially enslaved and tortured by them. I concede, his time with them might have softened him, but it shouldn't have made him so naïve and clueless as to how to run a criminal enterprise. Again, no problem with him going soft and maybe even good. But he should not be an idiot. Then, his time with them doesn't really translate to a wish to rule Tatooine's towns for peace and order. These are the very same people that hated and feared Tuskens.

I think it's amusing that Cad Bane leans into this issue. The writers seem so aware of the implausibility of Boba's character, that they have to have Cad Bane straight up ask and wonder what the fuck is wrong with Boba. What's his angle? Yeah, it's not very clear to us either, Cad.

Then there's the fact there's hardly any character interaction or development. Nearly all dialogue is just people describing their actual situation, and what they will do next, and then doing it. The finale get-together of characters old and new should work on a deeper level than the plain spectacle and show it provides. We should care about these characters and these relationships, but there's hardly anytime for them to be human (or alien) to each other.

I could go on. How reuniting Din with Grogu so soon after Mando S2 undermines that narrative climax, and resets the status quo so soon. How the best two episodes in the series hardly have Boba in them. How Robert Rodriguez has a talent for making everything look like an amateur fan film, with his odd action and blocking.

Really... just a waste of potential, but very fun for a mindless watch. 5/10.","this show is just flashing lights and explosions yeah its dumb fun and works on that level my monkey brain does go crazy for a second when i see an old character pop up or when things go boom but the moment i stop to think about it nothings adds up

"716",44481,4,"/r/lotr",1,"England has mythology and folklore already. They emerged throughout the history of England. ""His People"" already had that. Arthurian Tales, Angul, Beowulf, Historia Regum Britanniae. Tolkien's concern was a linguistic tradition as most of those stories, in Old English language, were either lost or supplanted by French.

Tolkien never actually said he wanted to create a mythology for England; that idea comes from Humphrey Carpenter's biography of Tolkien; not something Tolkien said himself. Nonetheless, the suggestion Carpenter makes about that is based on what Tolkien said when talking about a paper  on the Kalevala he read to a college society:

 ​‘These mythological ballads,’ he said, ​‘are full of that very primitive undergrowth that the literature of Europe has on the whole been steadily cutting and reducing for many centuries with different and earlier completeness among different people.’ And he added: ​‘I would that we had *more of it left* – something of the same sort that belonged to the English.’

The italics to stress his meaning; many of the stories of England's were no longer predominantly sourced or written in Old English; A lot of that has been lost.
Take for example the mythology of King Arthur. He is a legendary British figure but the predominant literature about him is from French, not Old English.

Furthermore, Tolkien himself suggests in his letter to Milton Waldman that he no longer saw what he was creating as being connected to England. This has been greatly discussed in scholarship when comparing his Lost Tales work onwards to Silmarillion. 

And even then we can clearly see his works developed even further when he simply created his own languages how many stories are preserved in those respective tongues within his work.","england has mythology and folklore already they emerged throughout the history of england his people already had that arthurian tales angul beowulf historia regum britanniae tolkiens concern was a linguistic tradition as most of those stories in old english language were either lost or supplanted by french

>Dunno but for me that's the good way of fanservice.

It's an issue when you have a worldscape the size of the galaxy and this stuff keeps happening, just through contrivance and convenience just happing to keep running into the same stable of people. He already showed up in BB, doing the exact same thing, like what, is he the only guy in the business?

Where it works: Somebody needs to find somebody who knows Boba Fett for some reason and wants information about him? They get tipped off about a line to one of his old colleagues, they end up knocking on doors, they find him, bam, opens up the door, it's the blue guy. It makes sense, they have a history, he's still alive and if the plot needs him to be accessible that's easy to write.

For example: Luke showing up in Mando S2. He doesn't just show up out of nowhere: Grogu specifically called out through the Force for any Jedi, and he's already known to be the only one really running around, specifically looking for other Force users and get that train moving again (although that's carefully not thrown in your face to foreshadow something) and once he senses Grogu he's powerful enough to track him. He's able to do the grand-entrance-cavalry thing as well as the ""holy shit it's actually him"" angle and it doesn't come off as forced fanservice. It was a reveal, but not a contrivance.

Where it drags, is the cartel having someone who works for them, needing to deliver a message, and it just so happens to be Cad Bane, as a coincidence. Out of all the bounty hunters/hitmen/mercs in the galaxy in the downfall of the Empire and it just so happens to be him? Especially since he showed up *the exact same way* in another show?  Like is Cad Bane the only guy pulling jobs in the galaxy anymore, did everybody else hang their guns up and retire? It was executed well, he had good screen presence and the CGI was done well, and it wouldn't quite bug me as much if we didn't already see it before.

If you watch Better Call Saul it does a fantastic job of bringing in established characters without making it feel like contrived, forced say-the-line-Bart fanservice for the sake of fanservice.

"787",27622,4,"/r/lotr",1,"My primary complaint with this is that it doesn't conjure the magic and awe that the Lord of the Rings did. That first trailer for the Fellowship of the Ring was perfect when it came out. It kept enough of the wonder and mysticism of story and the world whilst showing glimpses of characters and events that would keep you intrigued as to what was happening and why. It helped establish who was who in the zoo. This had none of that. It's just flashy CGI interspersed with more flashy CGI with fragmented shots of characters with nothing to back up who they are or what they are doing. 

Also, this just doesn't *feel* like Middle Earth. I understand that it is set in the Second Age, but the design that Amazon have gone with feels more akin to Warcraft than the Lord of the Rings. It looks like cookie cutter fantasy with big buildings and wide scenic shots to establish that yes, this is a fantasy world. If the trailer dropped and didn't say that it was for a Lord of the Rings prequel, I would not have guessed it was related to Middle Earth at all. 

On top of that, it all looks too clean and sanitised. The heavy use of CGI is reminiscent of the Hobbit films. But at least even then they had the right elements to give them their own aesthetic and feel. Not having Weta Workshop involved in the practical effects and costuming/weapons/armour of this project is going to be a massive disservice to the series, I believe. The world that Weta helped create felt real and lived-in. Everything was weathered, everything looked like it had its own individual story. The costumes felt like characters themselves, the sets looked like they had centuries of history behind them. This just seems like expensive sets sat on expensive cosplay. 

Of course, we have only a minute of quick-cut footage and some images from Vanity Fair to go off of. But I personally don't have a lot of hope or faith in this being a solid addition to the Middle Earth mythos, or something that Tolkien and his son would be proud of.

You say Samwise was strong enough to kill Frodo. That is the opposite of what Tolkien would have felt. He would have felt Samwise was strong enough to have not killed Frodo.

Catholic doctrine teaches that killing is a grave sin. The utilitarian idea that you can kill someone in order to stop some probable future catastrophe goes directly against Catholic teachings. While it may make sense from a logical utilitarian point of view for Sam to kill Frodo or Elrond to kill Isildur, that would have been seen as a staining act of evil in Tolkiens eyes, one that would have marred the person to their core.

Self defense or defense of another may lead to a killing which itself is not intentional. That would not be a sin in the same way, but an intentional killing in order to effectuate some possible defense of others is a sin (Catechism 2263). 

So no, I don’t think Sam would have killed Frodo.

And despite all that expecting him to be portrayed accurately is somehow STILL racist.

Where was the similar outrage at the depiction of Aphrodite in Troy: Fall of a City?  In that same show where Achillies was depicted as black, Aphrodite was depicted as a red head.  Unless i'm mistaken Aphrodite was always depicted as having either blonde or black hair.  Did you use the same energy to protest that change?

Elizabeth Taylor famously played Cleopatra.

Mickey Rooney played I.Y. Yunioshi a Japanese man in Breakfast at Tiffany's.

Mena Suvari played Chante Jawan Mallard a black woman in Stuck (complete with cornrows)

Ben Affleck played Tony Mendez, a hispanic man in Argo.

Christian Bale and Joel Edgerton played Moses and Ramesses II in Exodus: Gods and Monsters.

Alfred Molina played an Afghan man in Whiskey Tango Foxtrot.

Jennifer Conolly played Alisha Nash, an El Salvadorian in A Beautiful Mind.

Johnny Depp played Tonto in The Lone Ranger.

Josh Hartnett played Eben Olemuan a man of Inuit decent in 30 Days of Night.

Liam Neeson played Ra's Al Ghul, a villan of Arab descent in the comic books.

Where is the cultural respect here in this VERY short list? Double standard?  Are you kidding me?  It's a bad faith argument to say that Europeans are always painted as racist for expecting bare minimum cultural respect, when that same notion of cultural respect, historically, culturally and ideologically for the past century or so of filmmaking has not flowed in the opposite direction.  Barely anyone batted an eye at these castings, yet a black person playing an original character, well... that's just too far?","xb

not just that achilles had blonde hair but that throughout the iliad it was ridiculously important that his blonde hair and golden skin were so luminous and like the sun that people could tell he had some blood of the gods in him and despite all that expecting him to be portrayed accurately is somehow still racist

where was the similar outrage at the depiction of aphrodite in troy fall of a city  in that same show where achillies was depicted as black aphrodite was depicted as a red head  unless im mistaken aphrodite was always depicted as having either blonde or black hair  did you use the same energy to protest that change

it would be ridiculous for me to take say genghis khan and recollect the period of the golden horde by depicting him and the mongols as a little british men instead of mongolians

john wayne played genghis khan in the  movie the conqueror ridiculous yes  same energy

europeans are always painted as racist for expecting the bare minimum of cultural respect given to their myths and traditions and are similarly painted as racist if they dont display bare minimum respect to everyone elses its a sinister double standard

In Second Age Galadriel was one of the war leaders of Eregion in the War of the Elves and Sauron. In the early versions Galadriel is not present in Eregion during the war (she was in Lorien), and it's her husband and Celebrimbor (and later Elrond) only who lead the armies of Eregion: ""The scouts and vanguard of Sauron's host were already approaching when Celeborn made a sortie and drove them back; but though he was able to join his force to that of Elrond...."" - Unfinished Tales

But in later essays and notes Galadriel is there right side-by-side with Celeborn: “Galadriel and Celeborn, and their followers, who after the destruction of Eregion passed through Moria” “Galadriel and Celeborn only retreated thither \[to Lorien\] after the downfall of Eregion."" “After the Fall of Eregion... They had passed through Moria with considerable following of Noldorin Exiles and dwelt for many years in Lorien” In Eregion Galadriel and Celeborn took part ""in its defence against Sauron""

Above quotes are from Parma Eldalamberon 17 and Nature of Middle-earth.

In Unfinished Tales there's yet another wholly different version of Galadriel during the WotE&S where she apparently retreated from Eregion after its fall and ""joined with Gil-Galad in Lindon"". I should note that the Battle of Eregion was long, Sauron assaulted Eriador in 1695 and Eregion fell in 1697. Then three years later or so Sauron assaulted Lindon. So going by this other version of Galadriel where she retreated to Lindon, she most likely also fought in the rest of the War of the Elves and Sauron

Tolkien was still revising her First Age story and had not given much thought to finishing Second Age story in last years of his life. If he had finally finished her First Age story and returned to finishing her Second Age story, we would've known where was she in the latter half of the Second Age. We also would've known where was she during the first 1000 years of the Third Age. There's just many gaps in her story. Tolkien never really wrote what happened to Galadriel or Celeborn in this period of time (1701 SA - 1050 TA).  We don't even know if she attended to her daughter's wedding! That doesn't necessarily mean she did not just because there's a gap in her history. 

""...her status and power in Middle-earth on

but in later essays and notes galadriel is there right sidebyside with celeborn galadriel and celeborn and their followers who after the destruction of eregion passed through moria galadriel and celeborn only retreated thither to lorien after the downfall of eregion after the fall of eregion they had passed through moria with considerable following of noldorin exiles and dwelt for many years in lorien in eregion galadriel and celeborn took part in its defence against sauron

They got all of the Fellowship in one movie by cutting out huge swaths of book. There was barely any time in the Shire and no Old Forest/Barrow Downs. So they had the advantage of cutting around 1/3rd if the book. Two Towers had a huge chunk of it moved into the third movie and the Return of the King cut out the final act of the books and was the shortest book because of the appendixes. 

The Hobbit just didn’t have that much that could have been cut and, for me personally, would have been unsatisfying without some additions. Yes in the book we don’t see where Gandalf went to Dol Guldur or see the Battle of the Five Armies, but both of those things would have been weird to miss in a film.

Gandalf suddenly leaving without reason would have rung false to people coming in from Lord of the Rings and Dol Guldur was an important point in the lore. And while BotFA was skipped in the book being only from Bilbos POV, it would have been terribly anti-climactic in a visual medium.

"1032",32010,4,"/r/lotr",1,"There are no races in Middle Earth that can only be white. I keep seeing this argument that dwarves and elves have to be white, but that's just false.

Christopher Tolkien wrote in The Book of Lost Tales:  
>In the last paragraph of Appendix F as published the reference to ‘Gnomes’ was removed, and replaced by a passage explaining the use of the word Elves to translate Quendi and Eldar despite the diminishing of the English ‘word. This passage — referring to the Quendi as a whole — continues however with the same words as in the draft: ‘They were a race high and beautiful, and among them the Eldar were as kings, who now are gone: the People of the Great Journey, the People of the Stars. They were tall, fair of skin and grey-eyed, though their locks were dark, save in the golden house of Finrod…’  
>Thus these words describing characters of face and hair were actually written of the Noldor only, and not of all the Eldar: indeed the Vanyar had golden hair, and it was from Finarfin’s Vanyarin mother Indis that he, and Finrod Felagund and Galadriel his children, had their golden hair that marked them out among the princes of the Noldor. But I am unable to determine how this extraordinary perversion of meaning arose.

Elves literally don't have to be white. There's no evidence that they all were. Only the Noldor were ""fair of skin."" 

There is literally not a single mention of skin color or hair color for dwarves in the entire legendarium. They can literally be any color. There are seven dwarf kingdoms, only two of which are featured in the books. Why can't any of those be black? Moreover, the dwarves were created from stone. They should be a wide range of colors.


>A movie set in the middle of Africa, Asia, or pre-colonial America should not be diverse. Modern Europe and the US should absolutely be diverse. Living in a diverse culture, overall media diversity is a good thing, but applying it to certain specific/historical settings is not.

You should make it as representative as the places it was set. If you set a movie in Johannesburg, SA and had no white people at all, it would likely be unrealistic. Obviously the rules are different for real-world places than they are for fictional settings.

>That's great. About 20% of the US population are minorities, so this could actually be considered a perfect balance. Individual settings should have specific standards though.

I read a lot of Black Panther, a character created at yhe height if the Civil Rights movement with the name of a very active and known political organization woth the specific purpose of empowering black people.

And I read LOTR. A Fantasy novel about an imaginary world that the author made as diverse as knew how that tells a story about how many different people from diverse cultures and backgrounds come together to fight for the common cause of freedom and life for the whole world.

And no, it wasn't about ""whiteness"". Or even about giving england a mythology of its own, how many people claim. He explicitly denied this in his own letters. While his love for the anglo saxons was no secret and he lamented that a good part of their heritage and myth was lost after the norman invasion, that was simply one possible catalyst for his work, not the objective.

He instead created a whole mythos for the whole world that took inspiration from many different cultures and attempted to represent as mush of the world as he could, to the extent of his knowledge of it. Most of it appears to be of european inspiration because that is what he knew. And even then, ""european"" is a very broad and generous term that Tolkien, again, said he absolutely refused to identify with ""white"" or any such color attribute because he simply refused to subscribe to a race theory he considered racist, bigoted and unscientific.

Where some people see ""Oh, Tolkien chose to only include 'white' cultures in his work"" Tolkien himself thought ""I have included as many different cultures as I possibly could and if I had encyclopedic knowledge of more of them I would have used that as well"". He did not see all of these cultures as block of whiteness, nor everyone south of Gibraltar as a block of blackness or ""swarthyness"". He saw a myriad of peoples with their own distinct languages, histories, cultures and traditions.

For all his faults, what is truly admirable about Tolkien is that he was always trying to do better. He was aware of his flaws as a human and did his best to live up to a higher standard and attempted to communicate this through his work, hoping it would inspire people to continue moving forward.","by your answer no

"1052",30981,4,"/r/lotr",1,"I add to the comments about water and fire and why the ring wraths are afraid of those two things.

Tolkien comes from a Judeo-Christian tradition and the books have a large expression of his faith in Christianity. Water and Fire both large and important symbols in the Christian faith. Both are double sided with being destructive and purification. Water for example with the Noah story destroys the earth, but water after that is used a lot in rebirth. In the Christian tradition water is mainly seen as rebirth in baptism. Fire in the same way destroys but is a main symbol for purifying. Mainly example from New Testament is the fire of baptism with the Holy Spirit. Plus more on both sides physical and spiritual. Both a double edged sword, neither side helps evil.

So the ring wraths are afraid of the water/fire because it naturally can hurt you, but also the in a spiritual way being evil water/fire means rebirth and purification which would hurt them on that spiritual level.

tolkien comes from a judeochristian tradition and the books have a large expression of his faith in christianity water and fire both large and important symbols in the christian faith both are double sided with being destructive and purification water for exle with the noah story destroys the earth but water after that is used a lot in rebirth in the christian tradition water is mainly seen as rebirth in baptism fire in the same way destroys but is a main symbol for purifying mainly exle from new testament is the fire of baptism with the holy spirit plus more on both sides physical and spiritual both a double edged sword neither side helps evil

At some point in the 50s, Tolkien realized that it makes very little sense for Elwe, Olwe and Finwe to be brothers when they're supposed to be the first Elves that awakened.

Instead of writing a new line or two, Tolkien subsequently spent weeks and weeks and pages and pages mapping out the exact gestational periods, population numbers, rates of ageing, time perception, and fertility of all populations of all elves on Middle-Earth and Aman for the entirety of the FA and SA and created dozens of tables with population calculations down to three decimal points, all by hand.

Then he wrote an essay about how the Elves invented and used a decimal system based on their fingers in a similar, though not exactly identical system we use today.

Then he figured out the etymological history of all elvish names for hands, fingers and limbs in three languages (eldarin, quenya, sindarin) and how they relate to the words for numbers and calculations.

"1123",14137,4,"/r/StarWars",0,"I agree with you that this community can be extremely toxic. Example I checked in after Bo Katan got introduced in the mando season 2.  People were talking about Bo saying that the people only watching for baby Yoda wouldn’t understand but people that “were actually watching the show would”.  When that sentiment was heavily upvoted I knew there was a problem.

That said I think it is fine to say that I thought this show was pretty disappointing to me.

1. I actually was fine with the first 2 episodes and thought it was leading to boba using Tuscans as a military force at the end.   They were dropped and it made it feel even more obvious how few people he had on his side.

2. It’s funny to me that the lore behind boba fett is vast and he is a badass. While in the movies he never really did much and got taken out by blind Han.  This show seemed to somehow unintentionally do both it acts like Boba is a real threat and dialogue supports it but his actions are closer the the bumbling parody of the character making fun of his origins.  I would enjoy a hardcore old Clint Eastwood style Boba Fett or a parody mocking the character just don’t try to do both.

3. I think most people agree that the best episodes of the show were the mando ones.  Which would be fine but it makes lack in quality in the other episodes stick out.  It also hurts because otherwise people could just skip this show and it wouldn’t matter but some good mando stuff was put in this show.

4.  I didn’t watch the cartoon I only know of Cad through passing info.  I think the show could have used him early and possibly continued the flash backs with him so people that didn’t know the character had more emotion with him and would have tied to show together better.

5. I enjoy Rodriguez movies but I think it is fair to say his action scenes this season felt off.  Weird timing and character decisions.   The chase scene with the mods sticks out.  It looked like they weren’t moving fast at all and took forever.  The last episode with the decision to just keep clumping up the heroes or not use cover but it never matters.

6. think they gave everything that we liked about Boba to Mando so it was hard to have 2 shows about the same character.   The episode where mando shows up for a bounty and kills everyone in Bobas show is what I think people expected in the show not a crime lord that is really just wanted to be sheriff/mayor.

I think the show was fine but I won’t recommend it to anyone.  I won’t ever come back to it.  I think they could have just done something else or taken more time and have someone help Rodriguez.","i agree with you that this community can be extremely toxic exle i checked in after bo katan got introduced in the mando season   people were talking about bo saying that the people only watching for baby yoda wouldnt understand but people that were actually watching the show would  when that sentiment was heavily upvoted i knew there was a problem

 its funny to me that the lore behind boba fett is vast and he is a badass while in the movies he never really did much and got taken out by blind han  this show seemed to somehow unintentionally do both it acts like boba is a real threat and dialogue supports it but his actions are closer the the bumbling parody of the character making fun of his origins  i would enjoy a hardcore old clint eastwood style boba fett or a parody mocking the character just dont try to do both

 i think most people agree that the best episodes of the show were the mando ones  which would be fine but it makes lack in quality in the other episodes stick out  it also hurts because otherwise people could just skip this show and it wouldnt matter but some good mando stuff was put in this show

  i didnt watch the cartoon i only know of cad through passing info  i think the show could have used him early and possibly continued the flash backs with him so people that didnt know the character had more emotion with him and would have tied to show together better

 i enjoy rodriguez movies but i think it is fair to say his action scenes this season felt off  weird timing and character decisions   the chase scene with the mods sticks out  it looked like they werent moving fast at all and took forever  the last episode with the decision to just keep clumping up the heroes or not use cover but it never matters

 think they gave everything that we liked about boba to mando so it was hard to have  shows about the same character   the episode where mando shows up for a bounty and kills everyone in bobas show is what i think people expected in the show not a crime lord that is really just wanted to be sheriffmayor

i think the show was fine but i wont recommend it to anyone  i wont ever come back to it  i think they could have just done something else or taken more time and have someone help rodriguez"

&#x200B;

....However, there really seems to be some glaring spots to me. Ignoring the already mentioned best episodes of Boba's series not even having Boba in it, there's more to be addressed.

Starting a little with Mando s2 and definitely on showcase here, something feels very different with the fight choreography and scene pacing. I haven't checked through the credits of each episode to see who works on that especially, but there's a real notable sluggishness and more emphasis on set-piece than movement, tempo and weight, compared to Mandalorian s1. If you don't believe me re-watch how Mando infiltrates the compound to rescue Grogu and where they break out of the ruined building while surrounded by Gideon's forces. Simply masterful to watch, imo.

Cad Bane doesn't seem like he had any motivation for being there other than feeling like Boba got too big for his helmet and he didn't like that, I guess? In a way, I can see it, passing on the Pykes' betrayal of his Tusken tribe just to goad Boba....

Additionally, pacing of some scenes feel like they were a bit rushed to try and cram the set-pieces in to make for big moments with barely a scene of set-up beforehand. No way Boba's Rancor was still in his palace tunnels when the fight breaks out; what, did he fly in the jetpack to the palace to then gallop the Rancor across the desert to get to the city in time? Makes more sense there was a place nearby he hid him, but we don't know.

Last nitpick for now: the betrayers and the local Pyke leader got exactly what was coming to them... only, did Boba just tell Fennec to go end them quick and be done with it? Just kills them (artfully) and runs out, that's it. Why didn't Boba avenge his tribe himself? Even just accompanying Fennec to say some last words. Does he not care as much now? Did Disney feel it'd make him too much of a 'bad guy'? As a \*crime lord\*? Just feels weird.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Love Star Wars and the series, but fights feel slow, scenes feel more like set-pieces than character drama, and many scenes feel rushed to cram them in since they used two episodes to carry on Mando and Grogu's story outside of their own series (as much as I love them to death regardless).

Feel free to tear me apart on anything I'm blatantly wrong about, I just love the show and it almost feels like it's going intentionally toyetic in a weird way.","heres my thoughts theres a lot to love here some more than others and some more for the concept than the execution bobas crew being overwhelmed and outmanuevered then fighting back as the underdog and kicking ass heck yeah mando and boba fighting back to back hell yeah boba riding the rancor against siege droids fuck yeah grogu pacifying an enraged rancor adorable among several more moments through the episode and the show as a whole i really enjoyed it and happy to see passion for star wars

elves likewise are not as thoroughly described as you suggest and not in the main books as the author notes for exle you have to go deep into a supplementary language guide to get a single sentence suggestion that elves might have pointy ears based solely on a shared linguistic root for leaf and ear"

Like, if you really do want to have them end up back together, at least save it until the Mandalorian Season 3. Them separating was a huge emotional moment in season 2, and having them spend effectively 2 episodes apart from each other before reuniting just feels cheap. From a story-telling perspective Grogu contributed absolutely nothing to the final showdown in Mos Espa. He distracted Din for like a minute, then just sort of hung around with the mechanic lady while shit blew up all around him. His minor contributions towards the fighting could easily have been replaced.

In fact, the final scene with him using the force to calm the Rancor would have been **ten times better** if instead it was Boba himself calming down his pet, earning the respect of the people of Mos Espa. He would have shown that he cares for the people and doesn't want wanton destruction, but also that he is a strong and capable warrior that commands a healthy respect.

"1201",52320,4,"/r/lotr",1,"Hello everyone!

So once a year since college, my dearest friends and I play a LoTR drinking game!

It’s our favorite tradition and I thought I would share the rules with you all!

*(Also please drink responsibly y'all 14 hours is no joke!)*

So first off there are 3 teams! But there were 3 of us so we split that way!You pull characters from a hat, and these are separated into categories with there own rules!

Everyone gets Gandalf, and your Hero/ hobbit sticks with you through all 3 moviesthen they get supplemental characters, that change between the three films.  


First off is **Gandalf**, whome everyone has!

— Every time Gandalf saves everyone’s ass or has a serious wizard moment

Now you draw for your **HERO**

For the hero’s, ANYTIME they kill an orc you drink.

Aragorn- Anytime he’s reluctant to be king or proud to be king/ anytime he speaks in elvish

Legolas- Anytime he doesn’t understand emotions, or states off into the distance

Gimli- anytime he talks about how great dwarves are/ talks about Elves sucking, or his height is referenced

&#x200B;

Next everyone draws a hobbit(s):

Frodo

\- anytime he has the ring on, drink while he’s wearing it (continuously) or anytime he has a romantic moment with Sam

Sam

\- anytime he is reminiscent of the shire, or has a romantic moment with Frodo

Merry & Pippin

\- anytime either of them have shenanigans or say something stupid

&#x200B;

Now everyone draws supplemental characters , these change between movies! But one rule is consistent, if your character dies you finish a full drink!

&#x200B;

**Fellowship:**

Galadriel/ Arwen

\-Anytime Galadriel narrates or speaks in someone’s head. Anytime Either of them speaks in elvish.

Nazgûl

\-Anytime they scream

Boromir

\-Anytime he is tempted by the ring/ his death of course.

&#x200B;

**Two towers**

Theodin

\-anytime he fluctuates from being a hero to an asshole and vice versa

Gollum

\-anytime he chokes on Gollum

Treebeard

\-anytime he stretches a sentence or takes a long time to make a point!

&#x200B;

**Return of the king:**

Theodin

\-anytime he fluctuates between being a hero and an asshole , and when he dies

Nazgul

\-anytime they screech , including the witch king! And when he dies

Gollum

\-anytime he says precious and when he dies !

***Finally an optional rule, is drink anytime someone quotes the movie with the movie !Have fun be safe!***","hello everyone

Groups are... composed of individuals, though. I'm really not sure what you're getting at here. Are you suggesting society should only hold groups accountable when all the members of the group unanimously voted to commit to some problematic course of action together?

>	I mean the casting decision is probably up to casting director and Jeff.

I don't know what this has to do with anything, but it's also incorrect. The choices of the casting director implicitly reflect the values of the production crew as a whole, in the same way that any other component of the production (screenplay, hair & makeup, costumes, sets, etc) reflects the crew as a whole. They are all collaborating (""co"" — together) to make the end product. It's like how if you put your name on a group assignment in school, you get the same grade as everyone because the work is graded as one, and you're all implicitly saying ""I agree with everything in here.""","so this is the double standard justification

The goofiness of Bombur taking out all of those trolls by rolling around in a barrel then doing a tornado attack where he just spins super fast and takes out several orca was just ridiculous. 

There were also way too many things added to the story. Azog the defiler should not have even been there. In the book, he died in the same battle it shows him getting his arm cut off. Tauriel does not exist which means the dwarf/elf love triangle was forced. Legolas was not mentioned in the Hobbit either though I can see why they could use him since the company DOES end up being captured in the woodland realm and meets Thranduil. 

The excessive use of CGI as compared to what they were able to accomplish with LOTR without that was disappointing. And the Hobbit trilogy cost  several hundred million dollars MORE than LOTR so it wasn’t a budget decision. 

All in all, i still enjoy the trilogy a bit.

"1220",33585,4,"/r/lotr",1,"""Canon"" is a tricky subject in Tolkien.

Strictly speaking, the only things that are ""canon"" are those which were published by Tolkien: *The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings*. 

After his death, his son Christopher pulled together various drafts, and edited them together into one coherent narrative (including writing some bits himself). This was *The Silmarillion*. Many people view that as the ""canon"" version - but really there's not much reason to view the drafts that Christopher chose as any more ""canon"" than the ones he didn't. It was a complicated process to pull it together into one story - so he couldn't always take the latest version that Tolkien had written, because sometimes it wouldn't be compatible with other bits of story which he only had early drafts for (The Fall of Goldolin, for example, is based on a very early draft).

If you want to try and established a hierarchy, it would be:

*The Hobbit* and *The Lord of the Rings* > Other writings by Tolkien > Third party fan-fiction (which includes the movies, games, etc).

You can't produce a single authoritative version of Middle Earth. But then you can't do that for real-life myths either. Just look at the Bible and Christian teachings, and how many different versions and contradictions and translations there have been.","canon is a tricky subject in tolkien

There are lots of examples of lesser beings matching greater ones in Tolkien's work. Glorfindel matches a Balrog, the Witch King is killed by a human and a Hobbit with a magic knife, Turin kills Glaurung, Isildur takes an orc arrow to the back, the list goes on and on.

Then, near the end, Kylo is determined and kills Snoke with ease despite Snoke's supposed ""power."" This is because he's drawing on how much he cares about Rey as his source of power. In that moment, he's not trying to live up to Vader anymore.

The audience is meant to draw comparisons between these two scenes: they basically book end the film and take place in the same location using a similar setup - Kylo kneeling before Snoke.

Snoke basically spells this out:

*Where there was conflict, I now sense resolve. Where there was weakness, strength.*

Edit: Also, the use of Palpatine's motif within Snoke's theme could just as easily be indicative of Palpatine being the one behind everything.","i disagree

 I will admit that Boba's revelation at the end of Episode 7 kind of undoes what he was building towards,  but I think the bigger picture is that this is Mando's rising story; Boba is just part of his journey.

It seems fairly obvious Mando is going go end up becoming the new Mandalore (the Uniter?), and Boba's journey here explains how/why he would be willing to fight for a planet he had no stake in. He grew to understand the need for family from the Tuskens,  tried his hand at being a leader and utterly failed in all aspects of it.  So much so he even admits, ""this life isn't for us"" to Fennic at the end of the episode. 

Instead he has a new respect for Mando, who gave him an entirely new viewpoint on honor and the Mandalorian way that he never grew up knowing. 

Mando is following the King Arthur like tale of ascension. First came the sword and gathering of allies, next comes slaying of the 'Dragon' they alluded to on Mandalore. 

Boba is his Lancelot. Grogu is his Merlin. And I imagine with possible spin offs with Bo-Katan and Sabine Wren, we'll see these 'Book of' shows become, 'The Book of Mandalore'.

Later, they seem to be two distinct things, with ‘goblin’ being a sort of mountain creature first and foremost, and ‘orc’ being a soldier first and foremost.

In some translations, both words are unified into one thing.

"1381",10362,4,"/r/StarWars",0,"I think there was a missed opportunity to end the episode with a party in Jabba's Palace. I know the plot was geared towards the town, and making Boba a man of the people, but they could have achieved that at the end with opening the doors to the palace for them to feast and celebrate. The entire season we saw empty shots of the palace, it would have been awesome to see Max Rebo and the band performing while everyone parties around them. The Book of Boba was teased with him sitting on Jabba's throne - could have brought it full circle and really shown how different he is. 

Beyond that, agree with the general sentiments of this thread. Enjoyed a ton of this series, but not all. This episode was all action and didn't do it for me as much as some of the earlier ones. Thought Grogu might display some more significant force powers, as we've seen him do similar acts already and he's had *some* training now.

Oh, and if I could do one other thing differently about the entire series - I really would have played up his escape from the Sarlacc.

The positioning of Snoke in Palpatine’s role led me and many others to speculate whether Palpatine’s spirit would return in some form as possessing Snoke or using him as a puppet - the foundation was very poorly laid but there were breadcrumbs that fueled speculation at least. At minimum his inclusion without explanation and the cinematic similarities between his and Palpatine’s scenes in Empire at least didn’t preclude the possibility.

When Ruin cut Snoke in half with no reference of any sort to Palpatine’s influence behind the scenes, the series became entirely lost in the water. That’s an example of a man who doesn’t play well with others, a narcissist really, if benign and kind and compassionate- still someone who visualizes himself/his ideas entirely at the exclusion of others. 

Ruin got what he deserved when Jar Jar returned and cockblocked Ruin’s cockblock and produced a shitty final chapter that just imploded upon itself as the house of cards Jar Jar had ultimately built originally (Ruin just weakened its structural integrity - pretty badly to be fair-  but Jar Jar laid the foundations for failure with his shortsighted and safe choices in TFA), fully collapsed into a million fragmented pieces, like a Big Kid stepping on a little kid’s gargantuan illogical and entirely structurally unsound lego set.

4. Yes.

5. I also don't know this one. I'm sure someone more knowledgeable than me can help me out for this one.

6. I think once the shard broke off, it no longer served a purpose and simply disintegrated.

7. Elves are far lighter than humans are. The horse would have to carry less weight, and be able to go faster.

8. The Valar (basically god) of water, Ulmo, still has a lot of power, and water is very resistant to corruption. There's a lot of divine power from Ulmo still in water, so Nazgul can't (or won't unless necessary) cross it. They only crossed the water because getting the Ring is THAT important.

9. The Doom of Mandos (another Valar). Basically, the greatest elf to ever walk the Earth, Feanor, and his sons made an oath to take back a very, VERY valuable family heirloom called the Silmarils, and they're very determined to get them. The Valar tell them to come back to their homeland, Valinor, but they refuse. So, Mandos tells them that elves outside of Valinor will diminish and diminish until they become in essence what humans think of as sprites. 

10. They can, but they are much weaker in sunlight, and are practically blinded by it. However, the upgrade of the Uruk-Hai eliminated this problem.

>The film was based on God Particle, a spec script from Oren Uziel which had the main plot of the space station crew, but was unconnected to Cloverfield. The script was acquired by Paramount Pictures and Bad Robot in 2012. It had been initially planned as part of Paramount's low-budget InSurge distribution label, but following the folding of that label, its production was expanded as a Paramount-distributed film. Only during production did Abrams decide to link the film to Cloverfield, adapting Uziel's screenplay and adding scenes to establish the connection, after the same approach was used to alter 10 Cloverfield Lane from its original script, The Cellar. Abrams saw the particle accelerator accident as a cinematic means for future events to cause changes in the past, narratively linking the Cloverfield franchise together.

Elrond was not the only guy there. Glorfindel was also there. The problem is you haven't read Peoples of Middle-earth. 

Galadriel was also there. The problem is you haven't read the books and you are citing online wikis. 

in this version Galadriel leaves Eregion in 1350 SA, and tries to strengthen Lorien, and she herself doesn't return to Eregion when Sauron attacks Eregion, instead she sends her army to aid Eregion. She probably stayed in Lorien because she feared enemies might attack Lorien as well and she needs to stay to defend Lorien. Celeborn who had stayed in Eregion leads an army and greatly defends Eregion against Sauron until he with Elrond retreat and establish Imladris. 

However this story was later abandoned. In the later versions apparently Celeborn AND Galadriel led that army of Eregion, and they didn't retreat with Elrond to Imladris.

From Parma Eldalamberon 17: ""...Galadriel and Celebom only retreated thither [to Lorien] after downfall of Eregion.""

"" [The language in Lorien, though Frodo found it hard to understand, was actually, except in a few names of persons and places, simply Sindarin of Beleriand, brought in by Galadriel and Celeborn, and their followers, who after the destruction of Eregion passed through Moria... [This excerpt is apparently part of the draft of a letter to a reader, which is introduced as follows: ""I have not the time to explain the relationship of Sindarin to Quenya ..........."" The page was placed with others within the covers of the writing-pad labelled ""Galadriel"" ..... ]""

In a note from 1965 it is stated "" ....the story of Celeborn and Galadriel, and their connexion with
Lórien. 
The best story seems to be that outlined under “Galadriel”,  in which
they take part in the settlement of Eregion, and later of its defence against
 Sauron. But another possibility is that hinted at in the proposed
emendations to the “Tale of Years” (LR III 366), by which they did not
come to Lórien till TA 1060."" - Nature of Middle-earth 

No such emendation was made to Tale of the Years. 

And in 1969 Tolkien wrote: ""... Noldor (of Sindarin speech), who passed through Moria after the destruction of Eregion by Sauron in the year 1697 of the Second Age. At that time ... Celeborn went at first to Lórien and fortified it against any further attempts of Sauron to cross the Anduin. When however Sauron withdrew to Mordor, and was (as reported) wholly concerned with conquests in the East, Celeborn rejoin­ed Galadriel in Lindon."" And Christopher elaborates ""The implication of the extract just given is that after Eregion's fall Celeborn led this migration to Lórien, while Galadriel joined Gil-galad in Lindon; but elsewhere, in a writing contemporary with this, it is said explicitly that they both at that time ""passed through Moria with a considerable following of Noldorin exiles and dwelt for many years in Lórien."" "" - Unfinished Tales

This 'elsewhere' writing is published in full in Nature of Middle-earth, I quote part of it here: ""Thus already in the Second Age Oropher had withdrawn northward beyond the
confluence of the Gladden and Anduin: to be free from the power and encroachments of the Dwarves
of Moria, and still more, after the fall of Eregion, from the “domination” of Celeborn and Galadriel.
They had passed through Moria with a considerable following of Noldorin Exiles and dwelt for many
years in Lórien.""

Galadriel was a heroic defender of Eregion.","source to what  celebrians birthdate its from nature of middleearth 

elrond was not the only guy there glorfindel was also there the problem is you havent read peoples of middleearth 

galadriel was also there the problem is you havent read the books and you are citing online wikis 

in this version galadriel leaves eregion in  sa and tries to strengthen lorien and she herself doesnt return to eregion when sauron attacks eregion instead she sends her army to aid eregion she probably stayed in lorien because she feared enemies might attack lorien as well and she needs to stay to defend lorien celeborn who had stayed in eregion leads an army and greatly defends eregion against sauron until he with elrond retreat and establish imladris 

however this story was later abandoned in the later versions apparently celeborn and galadriel led that army of eregion and they didnt retreat with elrond to imladris

from parma eldalamberon  galadriel and celebom only retreated thither to lorien after downfall of eregion

 the language in lorien though frodo found it hard to understand was actually except in a few names of persons and places simply sindarin of beleriand brought in by galadriel and celeborn and their followers who after the destruction of eregion passed through moria this excerpt is apparently part of the draft of a letter to a reader which is introduced as follows i have not the time to explain the relationship of sindarin to quenya  the page was placed with others within the covers of the writingpad labelled galadriel  

in a note from  it is stated  the story of celeborn and galadriel and their connexion with
lórien 
the best story seems to be that outlined under galadriel  in which
they take part in the settlement of eregion and later of its defence against
 sauron but another possibility is that hinted at in the proposed
emendations to the tale of years lr iii  by which they did not
come to lórien till ta   nature of middleearth 

no such emendation was made to tale of the years 

and in  tolkien wrote  noldor of sindarin speech who passed through moria after the destruction of eregion by sauron in the year  of the second age at that time  celeborn went at first to lórien and fortified it against any further attempts of sauron to cross the anduin when however sauron withdrew to mordor and was as reported wholly concerned with conquests in the east celeborn rejoined galadriel in lindon and christopher elaborates the implication of the extract just given is that after eregions fall celeborn led this migration to lórien while galadriel joined gilgalad in lindon but elsewhere in a writing contemporary with this it is said explicitly that they both at that time passed through moria with a considerable following of noldorin exiles and dwelt for many years in lórien   unfinished tales

this elsewhere writing is published in full in nature of middleearth i quote part of it here thus already in the second age oropher had withdrawn northward beyond the
confluence of the gladden and anduin to be free from the power and encroachments of the dwarves
of moria and still more after the fall of eregion from the domination of celeborn and galadriel
they had passed through moria with a considerable following of noldorin exiles and dwelt for many
years in lórien

galadriel was a heroic defender of eregion"

Not quite. Neither do the Elves. Their existence is bound to the existence of Arda, which is a *finite* place. 

On top of that, their bodies will fail even before that. All bodies in Tolkien’s works are mortal and subject to age and decay, even if they can exist for thousands of years. 

The firstborn and the gods have spirits that can endure, and be reincarnated, and will always exist until all else ceases to exist. But Gandalf, as ‘Gandalf’, ages and can be destroyed.

"1556",6032,4,"/r/StarWars",0,"Unfortunately I’ve been watching his movies since Quinten Tarantino recommended the original low-budget Desperado (not his remake). They are all awful with the exception of From Dusk Til Dawn which had considerable help from Tarantino, action movies back then, in general,  were pretty bad, so he got by on Tarantino’s recommendation. I never saw Spy Kids though. He is big on hyping movie studio inventions that isolate the directors from outside influence. The reason I think why The Book of Boba Fett and The Force Awaken fail so hard and make so many mistakes (like the tie fighter suddenly having breathable air and a backseat that had to be retconned as a special forces tie) is because they bypass lucasfilm entirely and you have a studio that never touched the franchise involved in every aspect. Both directors come with their own studios whereas Rogue One’s director and Jon Favreau have the benefit of Lucasfilms design teams. I couldn’t stand how the new trilogy and even TBOB didn’t give us any new ship designs or world building only slightly altered knock offs. Give me the thing i fell in love with or something new, like the U-wing, otherwise it just feels like expecting a transformer and getting a go-bot. Knock off x-wings, knock off star destroyers, knock off darth vader. I can’t stand rich guy collectors like Robert Rodriguez anyway. He turned Boba Fett into what a trust fund lawyer with a star wars hobby would think boba fett is. The guy gets everything handed to him as he fails, a pet rancor an empire just by shooting one person, gets his credibility by being pampered by the indigenous folks like a tourist on holiday while his assistant does all the work and he wins people over by paying them money and hiring them. He even has a penthouse on top of jabba’s converted monastery.

That isn't canon, it is never mentioned in the texts and ***Tolkien himself*** drew hobbits with feet proportional to their size.

The brothers Hildebrant drew images of hobbits and *they* stylistically chose to give them large feet, my guess would be to emphasize the hairiness, and everyone else thought it was cute and ran with it, and now that is something people think hobbits just *have.*

"1690",30888,4,"/r/lotr",1,"**\*** **Enthusiastically rubs hands \***

Tolkienist here. Let's start and try not to give you a headache and keep it as straightforward as possible without going into too much detail.

1. It must be said clear that the movies are **not** the story. They are an *adaptation* of the original story in the books. PJ's movies while being truly revolutionary and becoming classics, are full of mistakes and inconsistencies and general fanfcition.

This scene is one of those. Sauron doesn't blow up like that. In fact he is brought down by 2 of  the strongest leaders of Men and Elves - the High King of elves Gil-Galad and the King of Men, Elendil. Elrond (Gil-Galad's herald at the time) and Isildur (Elendil's son) are also present but they don't participate in that duel of Sauron vs Elendil/Gil-Galad. Those 2 physically manage to defeat and (seemingly) ""kill"" Sauron. Only **after** he's physically defeated does Isildur come and cut of his fingers and claim the Ring. That big bang that you see in the prequel after Sauron blows up never happened.

2) Pure biology. It's the same as asking why are Elves taller than any other race or why do Men not have immortality. I'm only 99% sure on my answer so any fellow scholar is free to correct me on this one.

3) The screeching is a way PJ tried to show what you cannot see in the books. The mere physical presence of the Nazgul makes you feel afraid and is capable of overpowering you. They also have what is called ""Black Breath of the Nazgul"". Their breath (represented as shrills in the movies) can make you ill, overpower you and fill you with terror and fear (unless you're an Elf or a higher being).

4) It is heavily speculated that yes, the Ringwraiths are afraid of water and fire. At the Ford of Bruinen when they try to cross the river, the summoned flood kills their horses and destroys their clothes and they have to walk thousands of miles back to Mordor for Sauron to give them new clothes.

5) (My most favourire topic, this is where I shine the best).

They do. The wizards are not Harry Potter wizards in Tolkien's world. In fact, there is no such thing as ""magic"" or ""wizardry"" in this universe. It is just what the people call it because they don't understand it. In fact Gandalf and Saruman are holy/divine spirits (read angels) sent by the Valar (read Archangels) to Middle Earth with the mission to help the free people defeat Sauron. They take the form of old wise Men but they are in fact THE most powerful beings in Middle Earth at that time (save Sauron). The wizards are not allowed by the Valar to defeat Sauron by themselves, because that battle would be so terrible, the collateral damage would be too much. They take physical forms which limits their powers a bit, but they are still supernatural beings.

In fact, Gandalf, Saruman, Sauron and the Balrog in Moria they all are of the same ""race"" (read same level of angels). They are basically equals in might and power.

Gandalf's staff is not a magic wand like in Harry Potter. It is a sign of his ""authority"", like a sceptre is for a King. He channels his powers through the staff but he doesn't need it to perform ""magic"". Also, please remember, although Gandalf has some cool scenes, PJ heavily spoiled Gandalf's original image. In the books Gandalf is way more bad ass and courageous. He is considered one of the most important hero in this tale. If your sister hasn't watched the rest of the movies, I won't spoil anything.

6) Movie fancfiction.

7) Movie fanfiction (this scene was heavily changed in the book) but there is one interesting thing. Elves are lighter than Men or Dwarves. For example, remember on the snowy mountain Legolas can walk on the snow normally while the rest of the Fellowship is chest deep in it. That could explain this statement but like I said, this is not how it plays out in the book.

8) They are. There are many reasons why, one of them being that the waters of Middle-Earth, especially this particular river is ""hallowed"".

9) Ooff, that's a long one. To be as short as possible, Tolkien's world is supposed to be our world but tens of thousands of years before. The idea is that Dwarves and Elves ""faded away"" and the world was left to be governed by Men.

10) Let's put it this way - the sunlight (which is also pure and divine in this world) is very unpleasant to the creatures of darkness. They hate it and cannot tolerate it. It wouldn't necessarily ""damage"" them but it does make it difficult for them. This is not represented well in the PJ movies. You will see a lot of scenes with orcs under sunlight, which is wrong as in those scenes in the books the face of the Sun is covered by clouds that Sauron summons.

11) Fanfiction

12) That's Quenya, one of the 2 majestic languages of the Elves.

13) Technically this is wrong as in the books it's not a troll that stabs Frodo but a great chieftain of orcs. But in this particular scene, this is not one of those trolls that turn to stone by daylight perhaps.

Phew that seems to be it. Happy to answer more questions! Take care. :)","enthusiastically rubs hands 

tolkienist here lets start and try not to give you a headache and keep it as straightforward as possible without going into too much detail

 it must be said clear that the movies are not the story they are an adaptation of the original story in the books pjs movies while being truly revolutionary and becoming classics are full of mistakes and inconsistencies and general fanfcition

this scene is one of those sauron doesnt blow up like that in fact he is brought down by  of  the strongest leaders of men and elves  the high king of elves gilgalad and the king of men elendil elrond gilgalads herald at the time and isildur elendils son are also present but they dont participate in that duel of sauron vs elendilgilgalad those  physically manage to defeat and seemingly kill sauron only after hes physically defeated does isildur come and cut of his fingers and claim the ring that big bang that you see in the prequel after sauron blows up never happened

 pure biology its the same as asking why are elves taller than any other race or why do men not have immortality im only  sure on my answer so any fellow scholar is free to correct me on this one

 the screeching is a way pj tried to show what you cannot see in the books the mere physical presence of the nazgul makes you feel afraid and is capable of overpowering you they also have what is called black breath of the nazgul their breath represented as shrills in the movies can make you ill overpower you and fill you with terror and fear unless youre an elf or a higher being

 it is heavily speculated that yes the ringwraiths are afraid of water and fire at the ford of bruinen when they try to cross the river the summoned flood kills their horses and destroys their clothes and they have to walk thousands of miles back to mordor for sauron to give them new clothes

 my most favourire topic this is where i shine the best

they do the wizards are not harry potter wizards in tolkiens world in fact there is no such thing as magic or wizardry in this universe it is just what the people call it because they dont understand it in fact gandalf and saruman are holydivine spirits read angels sent by the valar read archangels to middle earth with the mission to help the free people defeat sauron they take the form of old wise men but they are in fact the most powerful beings in middle earth at that time save sauron the wizards are not allowed by the valar to defeat sauron by themselves because that battle would be so terrible the collateral damage would be too much they take physical forms which limits their powers a bit but they are still supernatural beings

in fact gandalf saruman sauron and the balrog in moria they all are of the same race read same level of angels they are basically equals in might and power

gandalfs staff is not a magic wand like in harry potter it is a sign of his authority like a sceptre is for a king he channels his powers through the staff but he doesnt need it to perform magic also please remember although gandalf has some cool scenes pj heavily spoiled gandalfs original image in the books gandalf is way more bad ass and courageous he is considered one of the most important hero in this tale if your sister hasnt watched the rest of the movies i wont spoil anything

 movie fancfiction

 movie fanfiction this scene was heavily changed in the book but there is one interesting thing elves are lighter than men or dwarves for exle remember on the snowy mountain legolas can walk on the snow normally while the rest of the fellowship is chest deep in it that could explain this statement but like i said this is not how it plays out in the book

 they are there are many reasons why one of them being that the waters of middleearth especially this particular river is hallowed

"1713",3954,4,"/r/StarWars",0,"The way I see it Grogu took the same path as Tarre Visla. He spent around 50 years at the Jedi temple. He's spent a brief period with Luke reviewing the basics of the force. And they made a lot of progress. As you said: Luke's training with Yoda and Obi-wan was also extremely brief. I think Luke made Grogu choose because he felt like Grogu didn't want to be there. I don't think he would turn him away if Grogu came back for more guidance either. Yoda also gave Luke a similar ultimatum at the end of their first session. So Grogu and luke spending a similarly brief time makes sense. He likely had guidance from the force ghosts of his teachers but they couldn't have been there all the time, because if this was the  case we would see them all the time (at Luke's budding jedi academy for example). It makes sense that Luke is largely a self taught Jedi, and he probably spent a lot of time finding republic era and ancient Jedi texts and artifacts to learn everything he could about the Jedi ways. I think people expect him to be this perfect avatar of balance in the force because George said he's the strongest. we see characters like Ahsoka and Qui-Gon who have realized that the Jedi creed has some deeply rooted flaws and while Luke has an understanding of the failings of the Republic era Jedi he still started out as a kid who wanted to be a Jedi just like his father. He's not neccesarily a grey Jedi. I think this version of luke, who is not the same as the one from the post-empire era books of ""legends"", embraces the detatchment from passionate emotion in the Jedi doctrine. We see him begin to do so in his demeneor and tossing of lightsaber in Return of the Jedi. So to me it makes sense that he teaches in a way similar to how Yoda and other ""nicer"" Republic Jedi would. I think Mace Windu for example would have been much stricter and harsher than Luke, and Luke is still pretty far from this.

>Did Tolkien say that interracial breeding was disallowed in any of Middle Earth?

I don't really care about the casting and are just reading arguments on both sides, but in Tolkiens work, it's very clearly stated it's just been theee unions between men and elves, Luthien and Beren, Tuor and Idril and Arwen and Aragorn. It seems the elves very seldom mingled with humans. So unless which you want to bring in forced impregnation, which honestly would be very off-coloured to add, elves would be very homogeneous. You could say ""well, one of the men were black"", but all 3 are related, so then you'd have to kinda cast half the liniage of men as black, which would be off-line again with Tolkiens mediaval Europe-centric story.

I think in the lore they are even homogeneous in term of communities in themselves. Noldor, Sindar, etc. mostly stick together it seemed. Even though it was not unusual to have unions between themselves.

What makes the 3 unions of men and elves so significant is the fact it seldom happens, and related to them are often a big story. 

But yeah, not trying to add much to the discussion, just pointing out that ""well, some random Haradrim could have a child with a random Elf"" is such a throwaway line and very off-line in terms of the lore. The 3 unions of men and elves have significance. The amazon series could add it to the black elf character lore and solve it, but then I'd rather have some elf be black than a 4th union of men and elves Amazon has made up. Thats more insulting to the lore.

Anyway, I have my own opinions about all of this, but don't feel like it's necessary to even write. If an elf is black, an elf is black. Not a problem honestly. My hinge is more related to peoples opinion about all this I guess.","you cannot imagine of a world which like england where there were darkskinned moors who were part of the realm and they commingled with the everyone else

>Rodriguez probably has complete creative authority over where meaningless dialogue and sequences are placed and how they’re done.

The point I am making is that the issue with that scene is not something that can be corrected with different blocking or staging. As written, it's fundamentally clunky and far too direct and linear for it to play as an organic moment between characters. Rodriguez didn't even necessarily direct it poorly.

Yes, he has control over how to approach the material as a director. But it's not a given that he has final say over the material itself or how Favreau has written it. It's quite possible that he didn't see anything wrong with this on the page, or at the very least thought that his approach to constructing that part of the episode would ultimately work on screen, but it absolutely does not.

"1872",20520,4,"/r/StarWars",0,"Its cohesive with itself, yes, but I think it is far less cohesive with TFA than people give it credit for.

- TFA sets Kylo up as basically irredeemable by having him murder his own father in cold blood (similar to Obi Wan and Vader, but Obi Wan actively fought him, plus they had a history as enemies). TLJ counters this by having him be far more redeemable, unwilling to kill his mother, and actively kind to Rey.

- TFA places a great deal of importance on Rey's family, with her actively wondering who they were, where they went, why they left her behind, with these revelations being highly relevant to Rey as a character. TLJ dismisses all of that with a single line of dialogue stating that her family is irrelevant and she's always known that. 

- Snoke was set up as a dangerous and mysterious new enemy capable of crippling the Republic, with Hux being a hyper competent fascistic commander. TLJ killed off Snoke with no fanfare and turned Hux into a joke. 

- Finn was setup as a full turncoat, who had stopped fleeing from the Empire and fulling committed to fighting with the rebels with his friends. TLJ undoes this characterization to make him a coward running from the fight until Rose convinces him otherwise.

- Luke was treated with extreme reverence in TFA, with the very mention of his name bringing awe and hope. TLJ turned him into a deranged angry hermit that tried to murder a family member and couldn't bother to try to fix the problem he created.

- Poe is turned from a highly competent, highly trusted member of the rebellion into an outcast criticized for actually trying to fight the first order instead of engaging in an unwinnable retreat, then crticized further for not blindly agreeing to a plan that looks like it will kill the entire rebellion because they didn't trust him with the details of the Crait plan.

The fight choreography is frankly some of the worst I've recently seen. Some moments were cool but for the most part it felt like a b-grade movie action scene. 

Boba/Mando flying down on jetpacks while shooting and some of the rancor stuff was cool but the overall battle was pretty lazy from a choreography standpoint, particularly the part where everyone joined up.

All of them hid behind that one racer car thing for like a good chunk of the fight. *All of them*. One rocket to that area would have taken all of them out. I understand you usually have to suspense disbelief when it comes to tactics shown on screen, but usually if it looks cool (like Mando/Boba fighting in the damn open for some reason, at least it looked cool seeing shit bouncing off their armors and seeing them use their tech) I think it would be more acceptable.

The final scene with the assassination of the bosses wasn't great either. It's the lazy-have them all standing still and see the laser shoot them down but somehow they couldn't see where it's coming from.

"1953",8289,4,"/r/StarWars",0,"Seriously, I went back and compared the Cobb Vanth standoff to the one between Bane and Boba and it’s like night and day. With ~~Bryce Dallas Howard~~ Filoni, the scene is slow and deliberate, starting with Bane approaching, then the conversation, then Bane reveals his gun and there’s almost a minute of tension before he pulls the trigger. Vanth is always framed on the left side of the screen, while Bane is always on the right, giving the viewer a sense of cohesion between the shots (this is even true with their guns; Vanth’s is on his right, our left, and Bane’s is the opposite). And the standoff tells a story. We get several mirrored shots alternating back and forth from Vanth’s and Bane’s perspectives as they size each other up. Then, the deputy comes in, and we get to see both of their reactions to him intruding. Vanth is momentarily distracted by the deputy and Bane seizes that moment to strike. And when he pulls the trigger, we see the shot from his perspective, then it switches to Vanth as he falls. Rodriguez’s standoff is so much worse. He tries to use the mirrored shots and framing thing, but the angles seem to be random, some shots just don’t keep up the motif, and he randomly zooms during some of them. Worst of all, he uses these during the conversation, not the standoff itself, if you can even call it that. There is literally no tension building whatsoever. All we get is a single, flat, wide shot of the two of them, followed by shots of the two firing FROM THE WRONG ANGLES!!! We see several quick close ups of Boba shooting, then a close of of Bane shooting, then close ups of Boba getting hit, with no shots showing whether Boba missed or hit Bane. These quick shots and the framing makes the scene frustratingly difficult to follow since the line of sight jumps all over the place.

"1992",12313,4,"/r/StarWars",0,"So now that it's done, Book of Boba Fett, as one of many lifelong Boba Fett fans...was alright.

Partly because Robert Rodriguez somehow can't convey a sense of speed during chase scenes, yet LOVES to do chase scenes, partly because it served almost as Mandalorian Season 2.5 (which isn't bad, but near a quarter of the show isn't focused on the title character).

There are some great bits. Boba turns out to be an total softy for animals, even giant monsters who you wouldn't expect to respond well to being treated like giant puppies, but it's Temuera Morrison, so they happily go along with it. The continued expansion of lore and humanization of the Tuskens and Tatooine is great, too.

The one true complaint is that this doesn't feel like it was, or rather needed, to be about Boba Fett. You could've plopped almost any character in his place, new or old, ans everything could've played out mostly the same. Because the most notoriously deadly bounty hunter now suddenly wants to run a clean local government? I mean, more power to him, but the show never makes this motivation feel natural to the character. Cad Bane has this whole bit with him in this episode about how Boba's really a killer a heart, like the show has been making this big point that he's reformed and turned to pacifiscm when he had his pet monster eat a man alive about fifteen minutes prior. I'm not saying it couldn't work, but it doesn't really work they way they've presented and written it.

What they really should've done was pull another Admiral Thrawn, and bring an Legends character or two back into proper canon. Specifically, Mirta Gev, Boba's previously unknown-to-him granddaughter, and possibly Sintas Vel, his estranged and carbonite-frozen ex-wife. 

The purpose they could've served would've been basically a transplant of their narrative roles in the books they featured in; giving Boba Fett people in his life he HAS to care about, has to be a better man for. At first its biological obligation and trying to do right by them FOR ONCE after his presence and helpfulness in their lives being intermittent to nonexistent, and eventually it starts coming from a place of love he didn't think he still had in him any longer. Introduce that element, of family that he sees as an obligating force for him to clean up his act and help provide for to make up for a lifetime of absence, and to do so in a way he thinks they would most approve of, and ALL his motivation from the Tuskens onwards makes more sense than what we got. 

I'm not saying its impossible for Bobba Fett to decide to say ""Fuck the crime establishment"" and try and build something on mutual cooperative interest and civil care, but it feels weird that he comes to that after just a few months (or however long) of living with the Tuskens, after they nearly enslaved him. A greater personal impetus for his change in goals and methods would've made it feel more authentic and given him a tad more depth as a character, AND would've also made him fighting tooth and nail for this make more sense. Because the Hutts and gangs and Syndicates aren't just threatening him; they're threatening his FAMILY. The only family he has left, that he didn't KNOW he had left prior to them appearing in his life again, and who he is determined to do right by, and do so rightly.","so now that its done book of boba fett as one of many lifelong boba fett fanswas alright

The best parts of the show had nothing to do with the titular character, and a lot of what the plot centered around was clunky and seemingly there for fan service. The major battles and action sequences left me scratching my head, as it seemed like the action was a slow burn affair and the result of characters making intentionally poor choices for the sake of the plot. The chases weren’t fast, the shootouts never felt thrilling, a couple of majorly badass characters potential felt completely wasted (fennec, the master assassin who amounts to little more than the hand of the king, and cad bane, who is killed in a 2 minute duel). As a minor pit stop between The Mandalorian seasons, the best parts of the series centered around Din and episodes 5 and 6, which had no Fett in them whatsoever. Even then, when all of the characters assembled for the final battle, Din felt basically useless, and was mostly there so Grogu could show up to literally and metaphorically plot armor his way to a resolution.

I wanted so much more from this series but I can’t help but feel like making a legendary baddie into the town grandpa wasn’t the best choice for the direction of the story.
