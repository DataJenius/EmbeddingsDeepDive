The second. You can make the assumption that bullets can kill elves and I'm sure most people would agree with it, it sounds reasonable to me, but it's an assumption nonetheless.

>Tell me more about this complete world where Tolkien described everything in it

See the part I mentioned previously where I ridicule this exact attitude of ""but the author didn't explicitly say X *isn't* Y, therefore X is Y"". An author doesn't have to describe everything and them not describing everything isn't a free pass to make shit up and pretend that's what the author said. Do you expect character descriptions to always contain thousands upon thousands of lines saying what a character is *not*?  
Did you know Middle Earth has an island where aliens from a UFO landed and built a settlement? Where Tolkien mentioned that? Why would that matter, it's true simply because he didn't explicitly deny it, right?

England and Northern Europe is located quite north in the world, which is why humans there evolved to be pale-skinned, so they could absorb more sunlight. It makes no sense for remote villages located in a place like this to be so ethnically diverse when some modern cities aren't even that diverse. It makes no sense for people in this place to not be pale-skinned, given it's location and intended historical mythology. Such considerations should apply to the production of any movie or TV show. The cast of the movie Gods of Egypt should have consisted of Middle Eastern actors/actresses, but it was white-washed, which doesn't make any sense because I don't think the Egyptians viewed their gods as white people. Mulan and Raya would have been super weird and inaccurate movies if the characters had been animated as anything other than Asian. Although the Pirates of the Caribbean movies did include some diversity, they probably could have included more since by the early 1700s many ethnicities and nationalities traveled to the Caribbean if they didn't already live there. Game of Thrones handled ethnicity quite well in that people from the North were portrayed as pale-skinned and people from southern places such as Dorne and cities in mid to southern Essos were portrayed as dark-skinned. I'm just saying, I appreciate accuracy and I understand people who do. Not to mention, such racial diversity which is portrayed in this new series is not portrayed in the Lord of the Rings, which would imply there was a freaking mass genocide or such.","i do actually in my travels ive seen jesus portrayed as black asian hispanic and white and all are incorrect jesus was hebrew however i think most peoples concerns with the issue regarding multiple ethnicities suddenly appearing in middleearth is that tolkien wrote the lord of the rings to be like ancient mythology for england andor northern europe as in back before travel was common and when commonfolk often spent their entire lives within a  mile radius or less england and northern europe is located quite north in the world which is why humans there evolved to be paleskinned so they could absorb more sunlight it makes no sense for remote villages located in a place like this to be so ethnically diverse when some modern cities arent even that diverse it makes no sense for people in this place to not be paleskinned given its location and intended historical mythology such considerations should apply to the production of any movie or tv show the cast of the movie gods of egypt should have consisted of middle eastern actorsactresses but it was whitewashed which doesnt make any sense because i dont think the egyptians viewed their gods as white people mulan and raya would have been super weird and inaccurate movies if the characters had been animated as anything other than asian although the pirates of the caribbean movies did include some diversity they probably could have included more since by the early s many ethnicities and nationalities traveled to the caribbean if they didnt already live there game of thrones handled ethnicity quite well in that people from the north were portrayed as paleskinned and people from southern places such as dorne and cities in mid to southern essos were portrayed as darkskinned im just saying i appreciate accuracy and i understand people who do not to mention such racial diversity which is portrayed in this new series is not portrayed in the lord of the rings which would imply there was a freaking mass genocide or such"

21101,2,"/r/StarWars",0,"The idea I had was that Plagueis had learnt how to keep his spirit alive after his body died. Upon his 'death' at the hands of Palpatine, Plagueis' body and spirit were separated. Some time later, maybe post ROTJ maybe earlier, Plagueis' body and spirit bond together again, resulting in some disfigurement. 

Plagueis travels the galaxy, sensing what's happened through objects and places connected to the Clone Wars and the Galactic Civil War. With this knowledge, Plagueis seeks to build his own army, and starts scouting for Imperal remnants.

On this journey, his senses the dark side in another life form, Ben Solo and begins his communication with him, grooming him to join the dark side. This leads to Ben's conflict with Luke, and him eventually joining the Knights of Ren, who I think would be revealed to be Plagueis' elite task force.

While training Ben, Plagueis, going by Snoke at this point, senses dark side potential, young but familiar. He's sure of it; this person is the descendent of his apprentice, Sidious. The Knights of Ren spy on the young Rey, monitoring her, maybe even protecting her for an ulterior motive.

Fast forward to the TLJ throne scene, after an intense fight with the Royal guards and the supposed death of Snoke, the real Snoke appears from the shadows as his force projection dissappears. He explains who he is, what his apprentice did to him, and who Rey is. He offers her what she's always wanted; family. Under his guidance, she will not only follow in her grandfather's footsteps, but surpass him. Rey accepts his offer. Holding the lightsaber of Kylo Ren, Rey Palpatine leaves with her new master, leaving Ben to die

Over the next couple of years, Rey becomes a master of the dark side, learning how to utilise force lighting, and manipulate the force in much greater ways. With the crystal from Kylo's lightsaber, as well as a second one she earned herself, she forges a new lightsaber; one that can be used as both a single and double bladed lightsaber.

As the rule of two dictates, Rey kills Snoke, this time taking extra care to keep him from coming back. With Snoke's death, Rey assumes leadership of the Sith Armada.

I've bolded some key points...

We can clearly see Bard talking to Thorin in a bit of a harsh manner - a guilt-trip... they are trying to force his hand. His first words compare Thorin to a thief. Not a good start. He goes on to say ""we are not YET foes"" - clearly acknowledging they *could* be foes, if things don't go smoothly.

Clearly Thorin is paranoid of the not so friendly army (namely the Elves), and the thievery they could accomplish with such might. Thorin wants them gone (and those who may stay, weaponless) before they discuss matters of treasure. When his (fair) demands are not met, Thorin's pride ends negotiations.

Bard is asking for the Dale-portion of the treasure. Fair enough. Thorin notes it will be repaid, once the host departs. So Thorin isn't so taken by greed that he would steal. But Bard also asks for *more* than the Dale-portion... recompense for the Lakemen. This is where Thorin says 'no'. He notes the treasure is for the Dwarves alone - as it was theirs before Smaug robbed them of it. Bard appeals to pity for those that lost their lives and homes, but Thorin notes the Dwarves were in the same boat, once upon a time. Recompense for the Lakemen should not come from the Dwarf-inheritance - Smaug was the one at fault, not the Dwarves. And it's a fair point to make. Is it greedy? Sure. Is it unjust? No. Thorin makes good points.

Thorin could have just given the treasure out, and conflict could have been avoided. He was greedy, yes. That being said, he was also right... they were trying to get *more* than is their right, and being threatening - Thorin had be very careful, lest Erebor be robbed.

Consider this: if a homeless man asked you for money, you'd probably be willing to help. But what if said man had a hand on a holstered gun, as he's asking? (I mean, you'd give it to him out of fear, but I digress...) Not out of the kindness of your heart. He's threatening to rob you - so fuck him. This is the boat Thorin is in. (At the same time, you understand why the Lakemen are desperate, and would want to force Thorin's hand)","both can be true

Right so.

The big ones are:

- The whole Eye of the World scene is fucked. Only Rand and Moiraine go there. She masks the bond so he can't follow and Lan takes this ultra calm and just sits in Fal Dara. Until Nynaeve says Moiraine has a ""tell"" and she can track her where Lan can't...

- There's no Saidin or Saidar. Just the power.

- Rand's big finale is stolen and given to the female characters. He only defeats Ishamael (they swapped him in for the other 2) when a vision of Egwene reminds him how powerful and amazing she is and how he has to do it for her. And the bit where he appears at Tarwin's Gap and saves the Sheinaran army, inspiring many to become fanatics like Masema later on, doesn't happen at all.

- Tarwin's Gap. Instead of the above we get Agelmar's sister (Morgase-level weak), Egwene, Nynaeve and 2 wilders linking and defeating the trollocs. Its not explained how any know to link. All bar Egwene burn out. Except they take burn out literally and they are scorched to death. Except Egwene, who then simply cures death and brings Nynaeve back.

- Agelmar meanwhile dies at the Gap. Except rather than the open battle they put up a little wall to try and copy The Wall from GoT but do it terribly. No loss him dying since they portray him as a sneery misogynist rather than the soft-spoken poet who loves Aes Sedai for the help they've given Sheinar in the past.

- Sheinar's army is literally 30 lads on horses. When leading them to the wall Agelmar gives an attempt at a big LOTR speech (that fails miserably) and then they break into a charge. Only to enter the stables.... It was jarring as fuck. Camera cuts away and we come back many scenes later to see that it's dark and all the cavalry are manning the walls. Including Great Captain Agelmar. Who fights and dies in the most important battle of the age so far as a mere crossbowman on the wall.

- Speaking of the wall. Trollocs can now swarm and pile up exactly like the zombies in World War Z and that's how they deal with walls.

- The Horn of Valere was hidden under Agelmar's throne and all his guards knew it.

- Fain knew it too and was able to walk into Fal Dara, take it and walk out again with no hassle. Accompanied by Fades. Perrin, who's done nothing all season, merely watches. Loial gets stabbed by the Shadar Logoth dagger so should be dead but we've already been told he lives by the show runner, such was the outcry.

- Min is a world weary, cynical bar tender in Fal Dara who looks 48 and has zero chemistry with Rand.

- Big montage of how it's the women of the city who will protect Fal Dara and not its soldiers.

- The Seanchan come to an empty coast with huge mountains running right up to the beach. They unleash a massive tsunami to kill a lone child there. In reality that tsunami would've broke against the mountains and surged back out, destroying the Seanchan fleet.

- Suldam now have gimp ball-gags for some reason.

- Seanchan look like Stargate cosplayers.

- Stupid Rand, Perrin, Egwene love triangle that shows up out of nowhere.

- Rand finally calls Egwene on her nonsense in his only good scene. Minutes later he's back apologising telling her she's amazing and he was a fool.

- Dragon reveal is painfully shite.

- Despite that it seems like they might try and be ultra-inclusive and go for a ""many-headed Dragon"" so the girls get to have a go.

- Lan teleports in one scene due to editing that's so hilariously bad it should win a Razzie.

- Lan fucks Nynaeve and then kicks her to the curb the next morning like it was nothing. She takes this calmly.

- Mat chickens out of going into the Ways and lets them go alone. He pops up again at Shadar Logoth looking like a Sith while the Battle of Tarwin's Gap rages.

- The Ways are shit and can only be opened with the Power. Just to make the girls more special. Except in the next episode they forget that and have Fain able to make his way through.

- They show Lews Terin in a flashback. He's stripped of some of his titles and they're given to his female equivalent for the scene. The scene is in a peaceful city where his equivalent tells him, word for word, that his plan will lead to the Breaking, men going mad etc. At no point is it explained how she knows all this. The scene is depicted as an arrogant man not listening to a wise woman and going chasing glory instead of the reality that he was a desperate general trying the most desperate of long shots with just the men because the women refused to help since they fucked up their own scheme. The single, sole purpose of the scene was to put in-world Original Sin squarely on the shoulders of men.

What I can say is that if they are sticking to the silmarillion, and simply expanding upon some of the stories within, then yes there is a problem with having non-white elves, as there are none in the lore. Black and brown humans are described, but elves are either white or Grey.

If ""it's a fantasy world"" is enough cause to justify any casting choice, then there would be no problem with say, Scarlet Johansson playing an Asian woman in Ghost in the Shell. And yet most people would say it's a bit of a weird move. 

Again, I'm reserving final judgement till the show comes out, because I liked some of the changes made to the story from PJs LOTR, but visually his movies looked more or less like the consensus of what traditional fantasy tropes look like.

15246,2,"/r/StarWars",0,"I think Luke (like Lucasfilm) is still trying to figure out what role the Jedi should have in the galaxy. They're still trying to figure out what the Jedi should be. Lucas' prequel vision of what the Jedi were is not bad. They were not corrupt. They just didn't see what was coming. However, I can't see a return to that type of setup being very popular in today's social-political climate.

In the past, the Jedi were setup on-screen as role-models of morality. What Lucasfilm and Luke himself I think are struggling with, is how untenable that is. Therefore, screw it.

Let 'Jedi' become a term that evolves in-universe and in our world that refers to anyone trained in force use. Let there be different factions of Jedi. Rogue Jedi, Dark Jedi, etc. Have different 'Jedi Schools' like the ancient greeks. We refer to these schools by their founders or distinctive philosophies. There could be Skywalker Jedi, Ahsoka Jedi, Kanan Jedi, Ren Jedi, etc.

The Skywalker, Ahsoka, and Kanan Jedi Houses/Schools can be allies but have a few esoteric philosophical differences. The Ren Jedi are obviously going to be dark jedi and eventual enemies of the Skywalker Jedi. Perhaps the Ren Jedi could be a faction that broke away from the Ahsoka or Kanan Jedi schools. I feel the need to explain my thoughts on 'Kanan Jedi'. They are the jedi trained by Ezra if he is ever found and takes apprentices.

In short, the jedi are currently splintered and almost extinct. Let the splinter-groups prosper into independent sects. No council that rules all the sects. Each sect has it's own council of elders and those elders communicate with each other. Eventually, a Jedi Conference is established. Periodically, members of each sect will send delegates to a conference of jedi sects to share knowledge and discuss current issues. There are numerous ways these relationships could evolve at this point and an equal number or interesting jedi stories that could be told.

So, let's say a big story is brewing in the Mando time-period that involves Thrawn being a big threat. Ezra is found. Luke, Ahsoka, and Ezra team-up to fight this threat. During the course of that story, Luke, Ahsoka, and Ezra realize they have some very fundamental philosophical differences but put aside those differences to work together. At the conclusion of the story, they all agree to go their own separate ways and start their own schools. They all see the value of each others viewpoints and recognize (thanks to history) that it is best to refrain from forming an absolute order of jedi. They can keep each other check. Perhaps some members of their sects leave to join royal houses and train jedi warriors for those houses.","i think luke like lucasfilm is still trying to figure out what role the jedi should have in the galaxy theyre still trying to figure out what the jedi should be lucas prequel vision of what the jedi were is not bad they were not corrupt they just didnt see what was coming however i cant see a return to that type of setup being very popular in todays socialpolitical climate

The final film should have made this struggle within Kylo Ren coexist with his need for control over the galaxy so that instead of a pure evil emperor just wanting to be in charge again? Kylo Ren’s inner struggle could have been the metaphor for the balance of the force and representing a truly balanced force user who is able to use both the dark and light side.

TFA made Rey looking for belonging the most important thing to her character. TLJ deconstructed the idea of family and belonging in that Rey had the power to create her own belonging and now include others by keeping on with the jedi tradition. The final film should have kept with this by having Rey recruit force users interested in becoming jedi and starting a new nomadic jedi academy in honor of Luke, it being a jedi academy and in honor of Luke could further provoke kylo ren because of how emotionally painful his experience was at Luke’s hands.

Setting up Snoke in TFA was such a boring idea for a villain, basically emperor 2.0. TLJ killed him off so Kylo could be the main villain who we could also see struggling. Hux being set up to antagonize Kylo Ren in the final film and even potentially being the one to kill him in the climax could have been awesome. Instead in TROS Hux was giving info to the resistance? If anything TROS ruined Hux, not TLJ.

TFA set Finn up as a reluctant soldier. He didn’t want to fight in the first scene. He tried to hide. He also was trying to escape the whole conflict the entire time. It wasn’t until the very end that he finally stood up for what was right, and then he got completely destroyed. TLJ had to pick up the pieces of that, Finn should have also helped fight Kylo in TFA, reinforcing him as a hero and having an injured Kylo Ren lose to two burgeoning force users makes more sense than losing to just one.
TLJ continued this arc for Finn in the beginning, backsliding because he was almost killed and trying to run away again. Rose reminded him that he was looked up to and admired for what he did in the first movie, and that gave him the courage to continue the fight. The final film should have continued this and had Finn be actively involved with turning other fo stormtroopers.

Luke was shoved onto an island and only given five seconds of screen time for the entirety of the first saga film he could have been in for 30 years. TFA should have been using Luke the whole time and the whole plot around trying to find a puzzle piece to a map to find him? That was dumb, come on. TLJ had to have a reason for Luke not fighting back against the first order and being in that remote location. TFA screwed things up for Luke by writing him into a corner. At least in TLJ we had a reason that made sense and that reason was consistent with the story already set up.

I agree with you on Poe’s character to some extent. But TFA showed his recklessness often caused damage to those around him, emotionally and physically.

In fact, they are so isolated - they routinely discover the fate of family members, presumed to be alive, decades after their death. They are also four times longer lived than the race of men. Genetic drift might be relatively contained.

Alternatively, or in areas where the dwarves were more cosmopolitan, it is possible that those dwarves are presenting brown/white. Genetics is variable so a couple with a lineage of different skin tones may have a child darker or lighter than themselves. It's not impossible to skip generations.

31472,2,"/r/lotr",1,"Yeah, that's what most folks screamed about so loudly and less eloquently that entire time, including me at some points. The problem with the marketing is, that like you said, it shows all the things fans of other franchises experienced time and time again. Diversity in real life and representation of such in new movies and shows in our time period is important and even beloved when done right, but changing characters around and shoving this good message into things were it doesn't belong, only achieves the opposite. 


I would give as much of a fuck I give about elves at Helms Deep in regards to black elves, if everything else they would have shown me is great. I still wouldn't like it, since it breaks the lore, but I'd accept this choice, since it would have been made to enhance a product, like the elves at helms deep made the scene cooler. The problem is, that trailers, teasers, photoshoots, interviews and panels are all designed to give people a chance to build their opinion and up until now every single one of these are horrendous. Take the ""Superfan"" panel for example. They literally laughed their asses off on ideas that Tolkien had and wrote about and said things along the lines of ""imagine [thing that Tolkien explicitly wrote about], that would be so stupid and problematic"". Those aren't Superfans, those are 4 idiots posing as Tolkien fans who probably haven't even read any of the books or even seen the extended editions of any of the movies. If they use that for marketing, then they sure as hell dont give a fuck about the fanbase and calling us racist, sexist and fascist, doesn't help with that either. I dont get why a series set in a different world, a fantasy world at that, would need to have our diversity demographic (and with ""our"" I kinda only mean the american, because those diversity standards really dont depict the reality anywhere else in the world besides america, as a german I often find that rather weird, to see my country depicted in ways that make it seem like a reskin of america) and address our social problems. It doesn't make sense, even though they said it - saying something doesn't make it true.


I would have loved to see them do a series based on something Tolkien actually wrote about and I would have been fine with them including diversity, as long as those diverse people are only human, if they would have done that and just stuck to the lore they do have the rights to, they could have done something awesome. They could have included any social commentary, with just using the things Tolkien wrote about and it would be noticable enough to make the people happy that care for those kinds of things. What they are doing is, taking a beloved franchise and restructuring it into something that can spew their propaganda and push their agenda, even though in actuality the people in charge dont care for that and dont belive in it, they only do it, to get richer. 


They did it to Wheel of Time, Game of Thrones, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Star Trek and even games like dungeons and dragons get needlessly woke in some very strange ways to sell more stuff. This is a problem. Fans of those franchises kept them alive for all those years and now they want to alianate these fans, only because they want to use what we kept alive and thriving, to make money. And they dont care about the fans at all. Is it wrong that they want to make money? No, every sane buisinessman and businesswoman should focus on making money, but the second most important thing should be, that the fans are happy. What they do is basicly creating new, toxic fandoms for those franchises that they can sell anything to and while being a brilliant idea in terms of moneymaking, it destroys everything the original source was about and it destroys the previous fandom.


So yeah, without going into much detail, I can only say, I agree with you and I am glad that you could express what I wasn't able to express in such a good way, due to my emotional attachment to the source that they basicly raped, even though I tried - but in my defense, being called racist and sexist everytime I said something probably didn't help to keep it civil.","yeah thats what most folks screamed about so loudly and less eloquently that entire time including me at some points the problem with the marketing is that like you said it shows all the things fans of other franchises experienced time and time again diversity in real life and representation of such in new movies and shows in our time period is important and even beloved when done right but changing characters around and shoving this good message into things were it doesnt belong only achieves the opposite

36837,2,"/r/lotr",1,"I like to quote this scene as among those that simply hit harder when you watch the Theatrical Cut of the movies.

And it’s hard to pin down exactly why. One reason of course is the Intermission introduced by the 2-disc version, and the subsequent emotional breathing room and reset; but even when streaming the film, Gandalf’s death just does not hit as hard in the EE.

Maybe it’s simply a matter of time - in the TC, Gandalf falls before 2 hours of film have passed, and the audience might still be more receptive and less fatigued - but I think it’s a more deliberate matter of editing: the TC just never slows down as much as the EE, and when this *drop* happens as the Company reaches Azanulbizar, it feels like you’re allowed to breathe, and to reflect, and to mourn, for the first time since the film started. And when Boromir says *give them a moment*, it’s for the audience as well. Yes, give me a moment! But no, we’re off again.

This is not to belittle the obvious benefits of the EE, but like many I’d had watched nothing but the EE for ages, and when I watched the TC again, Gandalf’s fall hit me like a brick, in a way that it had not done for 15 years. There’s just a difference to that moment when you’ve not had the comfort of Concerning Hobbits, the joy of several Inn scenes, slower travel, and a much more elaborate, and homely, stay at the last homely house. Fellowship TC is a little darker, and a little more hopeless, and when Gandalf falls, it feels a little less sad perhaps, but quite a lot more desperate.

Maybe it’s just me. But I adore the differences between TC and EE; there’s many of those moments in the TCs, where the absence of something, or the closer temporal proximity of events, or an immediate cut from A to B, create elements of immersion and meaning that are lost in the EE.","i like to quote this scene as among those that simply hit harder when you watch the theatrical cut of the movies

""In rode the Lord of the Nazgûl, under the archway that no enemy ever yet had passed, and all fled before his face.

All save one. There waiting, silent and still in the space before the Gate, sat Gandalf upon Shadowfax: Shadowfax who alone among the free horses of the earth endured the terror, unmoving, steadfast as a graven image in Rath Dínen.

You cannot enter here,' said Gandalf, and the huge shadow halted. 'Go back to the abyss prepared for you! Go back! Fall into the nothingness that awaits you and your Master. Go!'

The Black Rider flung back his hood, and behold! he had a kingly crown; and yet upon no head visible was it set. The red fires shone between it and the mantled shoulders vast and dark. From a mouth unseen there came a deadly laughter.

'Old fool!' he said. 'Old fool! This is my hour. Do you not know Death when you see it? Die now and curse in vain!' And with that he lifted high his sword and flames ran down the blade.

Gandalf did not move. And in that very moment, away behind in some courtyard of the City, a cock crowed. Shrill and clear he crowed, recking nothing of wizardry or war, welcoming only the morning that in the sky far above the shadows of death was coming with the dawn.

And as if in answer there came from far away another note. Horns, horns, horns. In dark Mindolluin's sides they dimly echoed. Great horns of the North wildly blowing. Rohan had come at last.""","when gandalf faces the witch king at the gates christ that writing shakes me to the depths of my souls the writing leads to this scene with despair and hope

The Book of Boba Fett (or maybe Mando S2) was the first time we see Boba Fett as a protagonist. It's not a great idea to associate the good guy as being somehow pro slavery.

It is good to have a character like Fett who can be an anti hero. He can be complex and do bad things like murder, which in a world like Tattooine can be nuanced and explored on when it's acceptable in order to save yourself or others. But slavery isn't something that is as nuanced, especially in star wars. There's no enslaving someone because otherwise they'd enslave you. Most importantly, the name Slave 1 doesn't give us a discussion about slavery. It just makes Boba pro slavery and we don't even know to what degree that is.

anyway i just picked three letters that i thought would look good and programmed them and the handle scales in mastercam when i worked in machining

41436,2,"/r/lotr",1,"I’ve seen this argument used against religious people to explain the possibility of life beyond earth. The question is, why didn’t Tolkien? In a reflection of reality, if you were to ask about what Eru created beyond the planet Eä, then I’d say there is a possibility of black elves in another realm of existence, but I don’t think they could cross from their realm to Middle Earth and vice versa. Otherwise, why didn’t Tolkien explicitly create black elves that resides in the Far East or south?

Eru’s music was about the creation of time, the world, and it’s discord. It had nothing to do with the creation of Eru’s Children but what they will experience. The Valar had no hand in how Elves or Men would look like. That was through Eru’s and Eru alone (once again, why didn’t Tolkien create POC elves?). They only helped sculpt the world they would inhabit, and the strife in the music is what Melkor wanted to “create” as an act of independence and power. Creation was supposed to be Eru’s alone but Aulë broke the rules with the dwarves. But instead of destroying them, Eru adopted them because He was Good and Forgiving. 

Otherwise that is an interesting question. I don’t recall much on hair other than in the House of Finwë because his children with Indis had golden hair, while Fëanor and his descendants were dark haired.  It might have to do with giving a backstory on the significance of Galadriel giving Gimli three strands of hair. Other areas concerning hair is Melian and Luthien both of had dark hair (though in the Lays of Beleriand Luthien was originally named Melliot and she had gold hair). On a side note, the twins Elrond and Elros and their children are the most genetically interesting people in middle earth. They had literal divine blood running through their veins, which helped create the ethic group of Númenorians and their longevity especially their royal lines, which touches the King James Bible the Divine Right of Kings. 

What we know of hair genetics, which I don’t think Tolkien was an expert and neither am I, is that the less light there is the less melanin in general. Tolkien based his elves on the looks of what he view Scandinavian people, an ethnically white culture spanning over several countries now of whom are carriers of blond, brown, and red hair. He was in love with their rich culture and wanted to create a mythos like it, but not exactly. Cherry picking you know. I think hair color wasn’t about genetics in Tolkien’s work but a way of further dividing the Vanya, Noldor, and Teleri for the reader.","ive seen this argument used against religious people to explain the possibility of life beyond earth the question is why didnt tolkien in a reflection of reality if you were to ask about what eru created beyond the planet eä then id say there is a possibility of black elves in another realm of existence but i dont think they could cross from their realm to middle earth and vice versa otherwise why didnt tolkien explicitly create black elves that resides in the far east or south

15239,2,"/r/StarWars",0,"I love how the Vespa mods get spared and the Gamorreans don't. They'd make sense on Coruscant, on Tatooine its a total eyesore. 

I think the episode suffers from too many ideas thrown into the pot. The script really feels like  Star Wars RPG campaign being narrated, with author PC avatars thrown in. I felt no agency or suspense at all this episode for the characters. Two Mods, two Gamorreans are the losses? Somehow Fett & Friends somehow take out the Three Families and the Cartel in one go, so much for that buildup. The show's trying to be badass, but it hits as hard as a G-rated film on Disney's afternoon block. The Star Wars aesthetic can only carry something so much. Those Freetown Extras and Mod actors are fucking terrible at portraying a firefight, and those Mods are explicitly shooters in a space western. 

All this could have been solved by Slave 1; it's BOBA who has to stay on the ground -> nothing stops Shand from driving that thing high up in orbit waiting to respond, or better yet, idling at the Palace's hangars. Equally plausible would've been R2-D2 homing in on the Mando, pulling a Reverse Uno bounty-tag, overflying the fight, and strafing & torping the heavy droids out.

The only conflict I could see threatening Fett would be if Shand decides she's tired of being ignored and takes charge herself and actually plays the Daimyo role. This whole series has been lampshading about how they've all gone soft.

I absolutely did love Cad being an anti-villain in this. He essentially gave the fight to Fett, goading him, forcing Fett to get to the next level of badass. That reveal of the Tusken massacre absolutely did rile Fett up, but it also motivated Boba. Quite poetic how in the end, Cad was still the better gunslinger, but in the typical victorious villain fashion of gloating, placed himself into melee range against a capability he never knew Boba developed (Sand-Fu).

What happens next? The quisling Twi'lek would be the natural candidate to assume the Mayor's spot, especially as Fett has him under thumb. Freetown goes into formal partnership with Mos Espa. Fett has a hook now to go after what remains of the cartel on Tatooine for his Tusken tribe. Maybe some stupid Republic incursion to take full possession of Tatooine that Fett will have some inane conundrum over his claim versus what he believes is best for the people. I could see Fett seeking out the Tusken tribes to cooperate and coexist, not to change their ways, but act as an intermediary between modern Tatooine society and those whose ways see them as the hereditary rulers of the planet. To paraphrase from an earlier franchise: **God created Tatooine to train the Faithful.**

Ultimately, Grogu choosing Mando as his FAMILY is the best takeaway from this episode; even though their reunion midfirefight really felt forced (I loved his power progression, and how Grogu is not succumbing to the Dark Side in applying his powers). Go float rocks Luke, all you are doing is perpetuating a cycle of Jedi failure. Ahsoka was right there as living testament of where the order fucks up in developing younglings and being loyal to them, but nope, you are still going to solo this instead of utilizing her as the prototypical reformer; someone who has living memory of going through Youngling-Padawan, before the faults in the system prevented her from achieving knighthood.

30706,2,"/r/lotr",1,"1. Are you 90 years or older? 

2. You cannot boil such a complex concept as love or beauty down to a single perspective. Either can mean much more than one thing. 

3. You really do not understand what I mean by love. You can love something in many different ways, I believe the Greeks have something like 8 words for love that all mean something different. Your entire argument/discussion/comment thread hinges completely upon a disconnect between love and beauty in the context of the 30s. 

Everything that you've said is dependent upon the concept that, unlike the modern concept of beauty in which people fall in love with someone they find beautiful, which could be misconstrued as superficiality, Gimli only respected and revered Galadriel as beautiful because he takes what you call the ""30s"" perspective on the concept of beauty. 

There is no one concept of beauty in the 30s and a different concept entirely in the modern sense. Beauty has meant several different things simultaneously throughout history. 

First off, desiring someone's hair has many different insinuations that transcend era specific sociocultural norms. One is sexual, in which someone is reminded of the body of the person to whom the hair belongs, as hair is an extension of the body. Another is sentimentality, reminding the person of the personality that the hair belonged to or the concept of the person. Gimli's desire for a loch of hair based entirely on the concept of beauty falls more into the latter (although there are more than two) because he respects Galadriel and wouldn't be creepily masturbating to her hair. Regardless, the sentimentality of being reminded of a person whom he respects could, very easily, be regarded as love whether on the basis of beauty or respect. Both can exist simultaneously. And from what you have said the two are relatively intertwined. 

So... What exactly are you arguing? That Gimli does not love Galadriel? What is love? Who are you to define it so suffocatingly narrowly? As abstract a concept that love is how can you say that he does not love her in any of the 8 potential Greek ways? If one can love a country or the land they live on, nature, a people, a culture, a concept... why couldn't Gimli love Galadriel in any capacity? 

No one said anything about superficiality but you. You claimed that beauty in the 30s was not superficial. **That did not need to be said given I only claimed that Gimli loved Galadriel for her beauty.** That isn't any more superficial than respecting her for her beauty. Respect and love are also very similar yet abstract concepts. 

You think you're clever but everyone and their mother has heard the bit about the three lochs of hair compared with Feanor's denied request for one. You really didn't need to be rude about it. 

>beauty had much more value 

Have you seen modern media? Beauty means almost everything to everyone. I think you mean it had more depth, to which I'd say... what kind of beauty? Beauty has always been superficial to almost every degree, whether people show reverence to it or not.","are you  years or older

Toxic positivity involves dismissing negative emotions and responding to distress with false reassurances rather than empathy. 

It comes from feeling uncomfortable with negative emotions. 

It is often well-intentioned but can cause alienation and a feeling of disconnection.  

Toxic positivity is shallow. It’s a false reassurance. 

According to Tabitha Kirkland, a psychologist and associate teaching professor at the University of Washington’s Department of Psychology, it’s important to recognize that positivity is two different but related things: Our internal emotions and the emotions we project to others.  
“Toxic positivity is a way of responding to your own or someone else’s suffering that comes across as a lack of empathy. It dismisses emotions instead of affirming them and could come from a place of discomfort,” she explains. ","toxic positivity involves dismissing negative emotions and responding to distress with false reassurances rather than empathy

That combined with some of his own bad decisions created the mess those movies are now.

20374,2,"/r/StarWars",0,"IIRC correctly (I read Iger’s memoir), they ended up over-paying for Lucasfilm. Lucas was asking for something like $8 billion because that’s what they bought Pixar for, which was way out of their budget for an IP that they’d have to rebuild from scratch. They countered with something in the $3 billion range, but Lucas wouldn’t agree. Ultimately, they ended up paying slightly more than they did for Marvel (a studio that already had a thriving business), and only then it was because some change to the CA tax code convinced George it was time to sell.

Iger actually walked through how they came up with the number they did, and they basically looked at how much the PT made in theaters (as well as some of the merchandise sales) and guesstimated how much they could make with movies, merch, and park attractions in a worst case scenario situation, and came to the conclusion that they really couldn’t afford to spend that much.

My conclusion is that those early estimations created the urgency. The reality is that the IP was worthless for them until they did something with it. While it’s easy for fans to think every Star Wars movie would earn billions at the box office, we know for a fact now it’s not always a slam dunk. Imagine if The Force Awakens did Rise of Skywalker—or even *Solo*—numbers. Imagine if the reviews weren’t all that great and “Star Wars fatigue” was already being talked about… VIII and IX would have been complete disasters and the franchise would be dead before it even started.

Iger isn’t a stranger to the business. He probably knew giving Michael Arndt the extra time he needed to polish the early TFA drafts wasn’t really going to make *that* much of a difference for TFA—and he was probably right. 

The fatal flaw IMO was the lack of continuity among the creative team, not the lack of a plan or time to write story treatments for all three films before filming began. For a comparison, George never stuck to his plans, but it really didn’t matter because he knew the broad strokes of where things were headed.","iirc correctly i read igers memoir they ended up overpaying for lucasfilm lucas was asking for something like  billion because thats what they bought pixar for which was way out of their budget for an ip that theyd have to rebuild from scratch they countered with something in the  billion range but lucas wouldnt agree ultimately they ended up paying slightly more than they did for marvel a studio that already had a thriving business and only then it was because some change to the ca tax code convinced george it was time to sell

Fortunately, he was also pragmatic and adopted his ""art or cash"" perspective. 

In the end, the letter you quote among many others, all indicate that Tolkien likely would have held a similar perpsepetive to his son. His legacy was distorted and corrupted the day Miramax, New Line, Middle Earth enterprises and Zaentz started playing corporate games with the LotR and Hobbit IP. We may hold Jackson's trilogy in high regard as films; but they were far from respectful to this legacy.

in the end the letter you quote among many others all indicate that tolkien likely would have held a similar perpsepetive to his son his legacy was distorted and corrupted the day miramax new line middle earth enterprises and zaentz started playing corporate games with the lotr and hobbit ip we may hold jacksons trilogy in high regard as films but they were far from respectful to this legacy

 they eviscerated the book by making it an action movie for young people aged  to  and it seems that the hobbit will be the same kind of film
 tolkien has become a monster devoured by his own popularity and absorbed into the absurdity of our time the chasm between the beauty and seriousness of the work and what it has become has overwhelmed me the commercialization has reduced the aesthetic and philosophical impact of the creation to nothing there is only one solution for me to turn my head away  christopher tolkien"

The Star Wars franchise is a lot trickier for Disney to work with than Marvel where they've basically been able to do whatever they want. For Disney to do anything with established characters outside of the main ones there needs to be massive buildup and these characters will need to have their stories intersect due to how the universe is built.

Star Wars starts from the Avengers where everyone is together and have relationships which have to be taken into account for any past or future stuff.

It's clear that the marketing department has had a major say in general. It seems more like the more cross sell they can have the happier they are.

All in all, it's gonna be interesting to see how things turn out.

I understand wanting to rule with respect instead of fear but you're still (supposedly) a crime lord so a bit of brutality and fear never hurts to get your point across. If nothing else, this show showed me that Fennec should be in command. She has restraint when necessary, she knows how to play the field and she's incredibly dangerous as we saw in the last few minutes. And in a show about Boba Fett with two episodes barely featuring him at all, I feel like the show kind of lost its footing with episode 5 when it just became The Mandalorian 2.5. This show can't really stand on its own and it's a problem to me because it almost feels unnecessary. Was nice to see Bane and didn't think he was going to die to be honest.

32007,2,"/r/lotr",1,"Yes, whitewashing is a problem. In fact, purposely whitewashing is the exact same problem. Particularly now that the acting community is so large and diverse that any type of role can be filled with a decent actor who looks fairly close to how they should, which is what should be happening. There's also a difference between just picking the best actor for the job, ignoring ethnicity, and purposely changing ethnic roles. 

> When you're in the majority it doesn't matter much

Accuracy always matters. Saying it only matters if you're African, Asian, native to someplace, or something else is kinda racist. Saying this work is objectively better simply because we changed the color of this character's skin also is. It doesn't matter which way it goes, because placing a difference in inherent value based on skin color is pretty clear cut racism. Besides, when did I say I was in the majority? 

Frankly, I don't see how it's not insulting. ""Here, you can have this sloppy seconds character that's canonically white, but we just did a pallet swap for you because we don't care enough to actually create a role that's logically consistent with the established world-building/history.""

> I very much remember, as a child, being upset that I wasn't reflected in anything I saw.

I feel sorry for you that you didn't feel represented. But what I find more sad that you were taught that skin color matters so much you can't identify with a character who doesn't match you in that way. Major movie roles have been ethnically diverse for decades now, so I don't get why you'd want to force it on a specific setting. A color change in a historical European setting, where it shouldn't exist, is not the solution anyway. Instead, exploring settings where other ethnicities would exist or even be commonplace would satisfy everyone. These settings even exist in Middle Earth. 

Rewriting history is wrong. Purposely casting Anne Boleyn as black is every bit as racist as purposely casting Mohammad or an African tribal chief as some blond, blue eyed, white guy.","yes whitewashing is a problem in fact purposely whitewashing is the exact same problem particularly now that the acting community is so large and diverse that any type of role can be filled with a decent actor who looks fairly close to how they should which is what should be happening theres also a difference between just picking the best actor for the job ignoring ethnicity and purposely changing ethnic roles

41014,2,"/r/lotr",1,"If people accept the clip, though, and Tolkien's goal was to create a mythology for the British people, then this is absolutely how mythology works: it evolves and is retold. I wouldn't consider it subverted unless the themes were subverted (like, say an anti-authoritarian myth retold in service of fascism). The British people are different now (including diversity, addressing profoundly harmful colonialist attitudes, class, etc.) and were never represented rightfully to begin with (not erasing women) and mythology changes. You can see this with Arthur and the french romance versions, which are studied in Arthurian Lit/myth uni courses in England. IMO the issue with Amazon is the writing level across projects, esp. genre projects, the lack of authenticity and scholarly dramaturgy and how they do things internally vs the idea of evolving mythology. Another problem in this context is the Americanization of media (which is certainly presented in some of the approach to genre tropes and violence in LOTR).

One thing you may be forgetting is that the ring grew in its power when it was closer to mount doom and being destroyed, so much so that it’s power was impossible to resist at that point for anyone, as stated by Tolkien in letter 246:

""At the last moment the pressure of the Ring would reach its maximum -- impossible, I should have said, for any one to resist, certainly after long possession, months of increasing torment, and when starved and exhausted.”

So I personally think Frodo was probably still the most resistant to the ring’s power, considering his circumstances.

The Discourse(TM) around RoP is pretty toxic, but worse than that it is so incredibly *boring*. There is this exhausting trend in fandom communities where vocal sects of a fan base feel that their vision of the story ought to be the only interpretation, and any adaptation deviating from that path must be categorically awful because “I have a notebook stuffed with lore proving that this is bad, actually.” No meaning, no themes, no room for artistic expression and art criticism: just angry redditors crowded around the endless abyss of ‘canon,’ furiously scrolling through fan wikis and attempting to summon Tolkien’s ghost.

And like you said, it won’t kill the franchise even if it does suck.

LotR isn’t a sacred text, and it’s not a homework assignment requiring you to fill out a fan-wiki article to be a “true Tolkien enjoyer.” It’s a vast collection of artistic works in various mediums that should ride or die on the merits of the emotional and thematic impact they have on an audience.

 eastward and the east-shores of Endar (which is Middle-earth)

 Sea flowed together, and there were vast fogs and mists of
 deathly cold, and the sea-streams were filled with clashing hills
 of ice and the grinding of ice deep-sunken. Such was the
 Helkaraxe, and there none yet had dared to tread save the Valar
 only and Ungoliante."" ""Therefore led by Fingolfin
 and his sons, and by Inglor and Galadriel the valiant and fair,
 they dared to pass into the untrodden North, and finding no
 other way they endured at last the terror of the Helkaraxe and
 the cruel hills of ice. Few of the deeds of the Noldor thereafter
 surpassed that desperate crossing in hardihood or in woe."" - Morgoth's Ring

Then after surviving the Battle of the Lammoth she goes with Fingolfin and clashes on the gates of Angband. 

After the feast in Mithrim she goes to Doriath. 

After the Ruin of Doriath she escapes to the mouths of Sirion. 

After the Third Kinslaying Cirdan bears her to Balar with ship. 

After the War of Wrath she leaves Beleriand which sinks into the ocean. And settles in Lindon.

But girl can't stay in her own kingdom of Harlindon because she has no chill and wants to be *more* so she crosses the blue mountains and goes to Eregion.

She co-leads an army in the Fall of Eregion and retreats through Moria into Lorien. She leaves Lorien twice in the Second Age and goes to god knows where. Tolkien never finished the rest of her Second Age story.

 helkaraxe and there none yet had dared to tread save the valar
 only and ungoliante therefore led by fingolfin
 and his sons and by inglor and galadriel the valiant and fair
 they dared to pass into the untrodden north and finding no
 other way they endured at last the terror of the helkaraxe and
 the cruel hills of ice few of the deeds of the noldor thereafter
 surpassed that desperate crossing in hardihood or in woe  morgoths ring

then after surviving the battle of the lammoth she goes with fingolfin and clashes on the gates of angband 

after the feast in mithrim she goes to doriath 

after the ruin of doriath she escapes to the mouths of sirion 

after the third kinslaying cirdan bears her to balar with ship 

after the war of wrath she leaves beleriand which sinks into the ocean and settles in lindon

but girl cant stay in her own kingdom of harlindon because she has no chill and wants to be more so she crosses the blue mountains and goes to eregion

galadriel was a daughter of finarphin son of finwë first king of the
noldor she was called nerwen manmaiden because of her strength and
stature and her courage she loved to wander far from the home of her kin  nature of middleearth 

she goes to tharbad and then returns to eregion 

she coleads an army in the fall of eregion and retreats through moria into lorien she leaves lorien twice in the second age and goes to god knows where tolkien never finished the rest of her second age story 


but the point is this is already debunked by people who have actually read the books and know galadriel was the greatest elf adventurer of all time no elf traveled around and explored middleearth as much as she did"

Context matter. If Tolkien created a world where different looking persons mainly inhabited different parts of the world, as was the case before industrialization that shrinked the world drastically, turning that world to represent a modern day racial harmony and having a diverse outlook of people is bastardization of his world building.

I like your post a lot, but I don't necessarily agree with the idea that just because something is possible, that it can be plausible. The idea of plausibility is one that is the most subjective of everything you've said, which is exactly where a lot of these problems lie. EDIT: I know you're not saying that everything possible is plausible, it's more so that your range of plausibility is clearly more generous than that of many others.

One might easily argue that there is a reason that Tolkien highlighted human-elf relationships given that such inter-race relationships were notable. Consequently, it is unlikely that any other such relationships would have existed. Otherwise, why would you argue that such relationships need to remain rare and special? Why wouldn't it be possible for there to be many elf/human relationships that we simply haven't heard about? 

To use another scenario: is it plausible to have a dwarf/elf couple? Many would say no, but I could quite easily argue that if Legolas and Gimli could forge a friendship, why not a romantic one elsewhere, between other dwarf/elf pairs, or to have dwarf/elf families? Maybe you'd agree that it could happen, but I think many would argue otherwise. At some point, I think we have to accept that the concept of 'plausibility' only goes so far. Your argument of historical survivability isn't a bad one by any means, but it could also be applied to lots of other scenarios I could think of where it longer really becomes a tenable prospect.","one might argue that the addition of this relationship is already making less rare and special at what point do you start making a cutoff of rare

21179,2,"/r/StarWars",0,"Honestly, yeah, I completely agree with this. I could (and actually did originally) write an entire essay of a comment on this, but the best way I can sum it up is this: if the story had always intended for Palpatine to return, then why does it feel like the story of the sequel trilogy prior to TRoS would have made more sense if TRoS was building up to a reveal of Luke being Rey's father and that the final battle was going to be between Rey and Kylo Ren, with Ren in charge of the First Order?

Edit because I've finally had some coffee and feel I should explain the ""Luke is Rey's father"" idea: my thought here is that it makes sense to have that be the reveal because, well, Rey is powerful in the Force (so why not have her be part of the Skywalker family line?) and it would make perfect sense, if the retcon of Rey being unconnected to anyone HAD to happen, for Ren to lie about her origins because the idea of the head of the First Order causing the daughter of Luke to kill her father is EXACTLY the type of manipulation one would expect from a Sith, which would have also made his manipulation failing in TLJ and Luke's death being unconnected to his manipulations actually work better as proof of how much Ren is not actually as powerful a Sith as he thinks he is. I won't pretend that there isn't lore problems with this happening or even that it's a perfect solution, but it would at least have made SOME sense as part of a story that was building up to a big reveal, which wasn't the case for the Palpatine reveal.","honestly yeah i completely agree with this i could and actually did originally write an entire essay of a comment on this but the best way i can sum it up is this if the story had always intended for palpatine to return then why does it feel like the story of the sequel trilogy prior to tros would have made more sense if tros was building up to a reveal of luke being reys father and that the final battle was going to be between rey and kylo ren with ren in charge of the first order

38950,2,"/r/lotr",1,"Here's my take on the hair.

We have seen people say that dwarves are unlikely to be black because any time someone is not white, they are typically pointed out as not white. Take some dark skinned hobbits, any mention of swarthy men, sallow colored skin, etc. So we can assume based on this that Tolkien does not typically call out a characteristic unless it lies outside the norm.

On the topic of elves, a few elves are explicitly stated to have long hair. Using the same logic that people use to suggest that dwarves must be white, we would then be forced to assume that elves typically have short hair, and that is why the few elves with long hair are explicitly described as such.

Furthermore, on dwarves, the dwarves that would most likely be black or darker skinned have almost no mention in any of the writings. We don't even know explicitly where they live, and the best we can do is assume they live in an eastern range of mountains. They don't play a part in the stories other than a mention that they did come to fight with the big dwarf gathering against the orcs. So using the logic established above, we cannot determine that they are white or black because unfortunately they just never participated in the events of the west. That being the case, amazon making an eastern dwarf (and we don't know that she isn't an eastern dwarf) black does not break any established canon.

Nor, of course, do short haired elves.","heres my take on the hair

14959,2,"/r/StarWars",0,"I swear they just downplayed Boba to try and hype the other characters. Fennec has made him look straight up stupid multiple times over the season. Good to finally see the 'master assassin' part of Fennec played out rather than the parkour chase we got early on. 

Definitely amazing to see Boba riding the rancor and Din failing at it. Din has the symbol he earned, and Boba has his, I like that they finally displayed one facet of Boba that's 'greater' than the mandalorian. Of course we know of rancor imprinting now as well which adds into the rejection but I thought it a nice undertone. The King Kong reference with the rancor was cool I guess, but just felt like pandering. I will say that I would have loved to see some episodes of him training the rancor and instilling that bond we saw just forming. They really should have started airing Mando s3 with those two and put more focus on Boba. 

Speaking of Boba, does anyone else get clown suit vibes with the weirdly bright restored armor set, especially the boots? It feels more like a parade outfit than functional armor after the revamp. Wasn't really feeling the weird power pose projectile knee rocket thing they did. They're making him out to be an old man but he's got this agility activated weapon? Sure this episode showed that he's 'still got it' but this one just felt out of place. 

I can't say that bigger, badder droidekas impressed me at all. Especially when they didn't have their shields up while approaching, then activate them for dramatic effect, then immediately move with them up, the opposite of the original trope. There's no reason for the shield ever to be down if they could move with it. Also, they don't even roll, cmon now, don't give me an obvious droideka knockoff and take away the coolest part.

 Cad Bane's supposed death was a bit underwhelming in my opinion, but it is what it is. I did like the callback to clone wars, though, that's hard not to like. I think we can expect Grogu to keep growing into a jedi, just not the same kind as Yoda. I do like that the armor was chosen, it keeps the close tie to mando and provides an opportunity for Grogu to build a lightsaber while we watch. 

I can't just sit here and not call out the 'city kid' saving Krrsantan, dramatically tossing the arm aside, drawing his pistol on the three approaching Pykes, and decides that right then it's the exact perfect time to try spinning, that's a good trick right? This was honestly so bad and kind of annoys me that he survived and is sort of the head of the city kids judging from their intro scene, and the melon scene in this episode. This guy, really? 

On the note of Krrsantan, I was intrigued he got assigned the Trandoshan sector and was a little peeved all we got of that action was him getting swarmed and then his injuries after. The action we saw him in was cool because though it wasn't the most badass, he was still quite useful while heavily injured and I think that's a subtle callback to his resiliency in the arena, which made up for it, but I still feel wanting. The Trandoshans just kind of look googly eyed and not very threatening for being wookie hunters, I'd like a little more from their facial expressions I think, they don't change much and there's no real reptilian thing going on aside from their appearance. I was a little puzzled at the all of a sudden buddy buddy status between him and Boba, sure he gave him a job but could we at least see how they become friendly enough that Boba can give him a nickname? 

There's a lot that feels really shallow like the renaming of Boba's ship or Mos Pelga, to Krrsantan's nickname, or the assumed training of the rancor that would have really made this show stand out. If only they would have actually worked more on this show rather than reverted to the mandalorian for two of the seven episodes. For such a small series I think this was a very poor decision. 

Overall a decent episode all things considering, but I can't say that I loved this series as a whole.

EDIT: I really love how they made a whole scene about Boba having credits and insinuating they'd use it for muscle, only to offer only to the mandalorian then not use the funds he refused to get more muscle for the obvious upcoming fight. It made this whole episode focused on the fighting feel even more nonsensical than it does without that context. I guess maybe he'll use it to fix all the damage he caused to the city with the rancor, despite showing concern for the droids doing the same.","i swear they just downplayed boba to try and hype the other characters fennec has made him look straight up stupid multiple times over the season good to finally see the master assassin part of fennec played out rather than the parkour chase we got early on

i cant say that bigger badder droidekas impressed me at all especially when they didnt have their shields up while approaching then activate them for dramatic effect then immediately move with them up the opposite of the original trope theres no reason for the shield ever to be down if they could move with it also they dont even roll cmon now dont give me an obvious droideka knockoff and take away the coolest part

 cad banes supposed death was a bit underwhelming in my opinion but it is what it is i did like the callback to clone wars though thats hard not to like i think we can expect grogu to keep growing into a jedi just not the same kind as yoda i do like that the armor was chosen it keeps the close tie to mando and provides an opportunity for grogu to build a lightsaber while we watch 

i cant just sit here and not call out the city kid saving krrsantan dramatically tossing the arm aside drawing his pistol on the three approaching pykes and decides that right then its the exact perfect time to try spinning thats a good trick right this was honestly so bad and kind of annoys me that he survived and is sort of the head of the city kids judging from their intro scene and the melon scene in this episode this guy really 

on the note of krrsantan i was intrigued he got assigned the trandoshan sector and was a little peeved all we got of that action was him getting swarmed and then his injuries after the action we saw him in was cool because though it wasnt the most badass he was still quite useful while heavily injured and i think thats a subtle callback to his resiliency in the arena which made up for it but i still feel wanting the trandoshans just kind of look googly eyed and not very threatening for being wookie hunters id like a little more from their facial expressions i think they dont change much and theres no real reptilian thing going on aside from their appearance i was a little puzzled at the all of a sudden buddy buddy status between him and boba sure he gave him a job but could we at least see how they become friendly enough that boba can give him a nickname 

theres a lot that feels really shallow like the renaming of bobas ship or mos pelga to krrsantans nickname or the assumed training of the rancor that would have really made this show stand out if only they would have actually worked more on this show rather than reverted to the mandalorian for two of the seven episodes for such a small series i think this was a very poor decision 

overall a decent episode all things considering but i cant say that i loved this series as a whole

edit i really love how they made a whole scene about boba having credits and insinuating theyd use it for muscle only to offer only to the mandalorian then not use the funds he refused to get more muscle for the obvious upcoming fight it made this whole episode focused on the fighting feel even more nonsensical than it does without that context i guess maybe hell use it to fix all the damage he caused to the city with the rancor despite showing concern for the droids doing the same"
35356,2,"/r/lotr",1,"As far as I remember, Sam is the only one who really does just give the Ring away, but he only had it for a very short time. He only hesitates because Frodo is acting a bit Gollum-y about demanding it back. 

Of the people who were exposed to it for more than a day or two, Bilbo is the only one who managed to give it away. Reluctantly, and with a good push from Gandalf, but still of his own will in the end. Bilbo had had it for a good few decades by this point, and had been using it for the invisibility effect, not knowing how dangerous it really was. 

Frodo, on Gandalfs advice, keeps the Ring hidden and never uses it, so it has less of a chance to influence him. When the hobbits are at Bombadils house, Tom plays around with the Ring for a bit. Frodo does give it to him, but you can tell the first signs of getting attached by him being REALLY relieved when he has it back. Though to be fair, that could also be just being worried about the super-dangerous artefact he's been tasked with keeping safe. 

At the Council of Elrond, at least in the book, he doesn't actually give it away, he just shows it to everyone.

Then someone said, ""Let's make ~~money~~ movies!"" They rightly wanted to keep ""The News from Lake Wobegon"" to a minimum. The movies HAD to be untrue to the pacing and detail of the books.

And, yet, despite Peter Jackson and others clearly being aware of this fact, as action movies, ""The Lord of the Rings"" gets tedious and boring. Still using the opening as an example: If they (again, rightly) didn't want to do The Shire justice, why spend *any* time in The Shire?

Frankly, I think they were all kinds of stupid for limiting themselves to three movies. Pacing-wise, they shot themselves in the foot; those movies drag at times.

> I am speaking here, of course, of the primary expression of Fantasy in “pictorial” arts, not of “illustrations”; nor of the cinematograph. However good in themselves, illustrations do little good to fairy-stories. The radical distinction between all art (including drama) that offers a visible presentation and true literature is that it imposes one visible form. Literature works from mind to mind and is thus more progenitive. It is at once more universal and more poignantly particular. If it speaks of bread or wine or stone or tree, it appeals to the whole of these things, to their ideas; yet each hearer will give to them a peculiar personal embodiment in his imagination. Should the story say “he ate bread,” the dramatic producer or painter can only show ”a piece of bread” according to his taste or fancy, but the hearer of the story will think of bread in general and picture it in some form of his own. If a story says “he climbed a hill and saw a river in the valley below,” the illustrator may catch, or nearly catch, his own vision of such a scene; but every hearer of the words will have his own picture, and it will be made out of all the hills and rivers and dales he has ever seen, but especially out of The Hill, The River, The Valley which were for him the first embodiment of the word.","this discussion had me go back to on fairystories and this reflection on surrealism vs fantasy which i find relevant

53048,2,"/r/lotr",1,"Sorry, I should have been clearer in my original post.

First, I want to clarify that I'm not talking about Tolkien's intentions. He wrote extensively about what he was trying to do with his work, and it's clear that he was, at least initially, inspired to fill in the gaps he identified in Britain's mythological tradition. In any case, I am less interested in what Tolkien intended his work to be, and how his work actually functions in our culture. I am arguing that his work has, in part, functioned to construct white indentity. 

Now the unstated assumption behind my claims is that whiteness is not only a construct, but it is a relatively modern construct that has needed to constantly update itself since its inception. If you don't agree with that then I think anything else I would have to say you wouldn't agree with either. I think we probably don't agree on what race is, because you ask me what I would include in ""whiteness"". This is an impossible question to answer  because whiteness is constantly evolving and it changes with context. 

But moving forward with that assumption, I am arguing that Tolkien's work has been part of that process of constructing white identity. The fantasy genre as a whole tends to compress influences from European cultures throughout millenia and across the continent into single worlds. This serves to reinforce the idea of a hegemonic white European culture across time that is distinct from non-white cultures. Tolkien is certainly not the originator of this idea, but he lived in a society that did not question the boundaries of whiteness, and so it should not be surprising that he wrote a story that did not  actively work to deconstruct race (nor is it offensive to point that out, as some have suggested). 

More importantly, though, I am arguing that the fan response to diversity in ROP is evidence of the way Tolkien's works function in society. It is telling that diverse casting is met with such vocal criticism. It seems to me that whether or not we acknowledge it, the Lord of the Rings does hold an important place in the modern white identity (serving a similar connection to identity as ancient mythology had to ancient cultures), and some people view the inclusion of non-white characters as a threat to that identity. 

This is what I mean by the fact that we should stop gate keeping fantasy. Of course, as you point out, anyone can write whatever fan fiction they want, and even, to a lesser extent, film whatever content they want. But the reality is that the backlash against diverse casting in ROP was predictable, and it is not comparable to the criticism the show has received for more major lore changes, like the timeline compression. Every time a well-known fantasy property includes people of colour these kinds of negative comments are made. At some point we need to accept that there's nothing wrong with black elves.","sorry i should have been clearer in my original post

38679,2,"/r/lotr",1,"People of all skin tones should see themselves in Rings of Power so they can more easily have the experience that white people like me had when I saw someone who looked like me on screen and started projecting myself onto them. Now obviously that doesn't necessarily need to be a match for skintone or gender etc, but typically those are determining factors in which character you will relate to.

I don't think the theme gets lost when everyone is white (the Peter Jackson movies still convey this theme wonderfully), but it would be stronger if there was more diversity of skintone. Because the theme is about strength of diversity, so the more diverse you can make it (without contradicting lore) the stronger that theme is going to be conveyed.

I think that, as people who have seen characters that look like us in prominent and heroic roles for decades, we sometimes don't realize that some people feel like there isn't a place for them in a particular world they enjoy. Or that their place would only be in a background capacity or on the side of evil.

37548,2,"/r/lotr",1,"I would definintely agree, the text definitely makes it sound like this is Frodo's perception, rather than Bilbo changing. And disturbingly so, especially the ""desire to strike him"":

> When he had dressed, Frodo found that while he slept the Ring had been hung about his neck on a new chain, light but strong. Slowly he drew it out. Bilbo put out his hand. But Frodo quickly drew back the Ring. To his distress and amazement he found that he was no longer looking at Bilbo; a shadow seemed to have fallen between them, and through it he found himself eyeing a little wrinkled creature with a hungry face and bony groping hands. He felt a desire to strike him.

Bilbo reads and understands this incredibly well. He realises that he shouldn't have asked Frodo about the Ring, and I think that this is perhaps one of the first times that he truly realises the effect that the Ring has on Frodo (and on him). And then he swiftly changes the subject:

> The music and singing round them seemed to falter, and a silence fell. Bilbo looked quickly at Frodo’s face and passed his hand across his eyes. ‘I understand now,’ he said. ‘Put it away! I am sorry: sorry you have come in for this burden; sorry about everything. Don’t adventures ever have an end? I suppose not. Someone else always has to carry on the story. Well, it can’t be helped. I wonder if it’s any good trying to finish my book? But don’t let’s worry about it now – let’s have some real News! Tell me all about the Shire!’

I wonder if Bilbo saw something similar when Gandalf asked him for the Ring? Like Frodo, he's clearly disturbed by the request, and thinks about violence:

> ‘Well, if you want my ring yourself, say so!’ cried Bilbo. ‘But you won’t get it. I won’t give my Precious away, I tell you.’ His hand strayed to the hilt of his small sword.

We even get the same language, talking about a shadow, and the same response from Bilbo:

> ‘I have never called you one,’ Gandalf answered. ‘And I am not one either. I am not trying to rob you, but to help you. I wish you would trust me, as you used.’ He turned away, and **the shadow passed**. He seemed to dwindle again to an old grey man, bent and troubled.  
> **Bilbo drew his hand over his eyes**. ‘I am sorry,’ he said. ‘But I felt so queer. And yet it would be a relief in a way not to be bothered with it any more. It has been so growing on my mind lately. Sometimes I have felt it was like an eye looking at me. And I am always wanting to put it on and disappear, don’t you know; or wondering if it is safe, and pulling it out to make sure. I tried locking it up, but I found I couldn’t rest without it in my pocket. I don’t know why. And I don’t seem able to make up my mind.’

I think that it being Frodo's change in perception rather than a physical change in Bilbo is much better. But how do you communicate that in an movie? I suppose if we're seeing from Frodo's point of view, perhaps that's all in was in the movie as well?","i would definintely agree the text definitely makes it sound like this is frodos perception rather than bilbo changing and disturbingly so especially the desire to strike him

45657,2,"/r/lotr",1,"I’m not calling anyone a racist or a “Nazi.” The point that you’re making would be valid if we were talking about Bridgerton, or casting a black guy to play King Henry V. 

But Middle-Earth is fictional. To say that it’s “based upon medieval Europe” when it includes places like Mordor and Lothlorien, includes creatures like the balrog, includes rings of power and wizards and hobbits and orcs … surely none of THAT stuff was in medieval Europe, yes? So, it seems that Middle-Earth is already not COMPLETELY accurate to medieval Europe. 

What I don’t understand (and what I’d like for you to address) is this: if someone is a proponent of accuracy to medieval Europe, why would they be okay with the existence of fucking Balrogs, but not okay with the existence of black dwarves? Why is it that it’s okay for Tolkien to base SOME stuff upon medieval Europe, while pulling other stuff straight from his imagination or general fantasy lore, but when it comes to the Amazon show, it has to be PRECISELY accurate to medieval Europe? Why is it that skin pigmentation is more important than fucking magic? Why is it that, when it comes to locations or mythological creatures, it’s totally fine for Middle-Earth to not be accurate to medieval Europe, but when it comes to the skin color of the characters, Middle-Earth has to be EXACTLY accurate to medieval Europe? (assuming that there were zero people of color in medieval Europe, which I doubt tbh, but sure, let’s go with that)

It’s not so much that I’m “lost in my argument.” It’s that your argument isn’t that convincing. Middle-Earth is, if anything, LOOSELY based upon medieval Europe, and as such, the skin colors of the characters need also only be LOOSELY based upon medieval Europe.

It just seems silly to me. “Balrogs are fine, but BLACK ELVES??? That’s just so UNREALISTIC!” The reason why people with views like that get called “racist,” is because the arguments they offer for why they feel the way they do often fall apart upon literally any level of in-depth analysis. And so, if all of their arguments prove to be pretextual, if their logic is inconsistent and hypocritical … what is it, then? What is it that “activates something in the mind that something is NOT RIGHT” (to quote your words) when these people see a black dwarf, or black elf, or black Superman? What could it be, other than ignorance? Other than bigotry?

As a general rule, if seeing black skin “activates” fucking anything in your mind, you should maybe analyze that …","im not calling anyone a racist or a nazi the point that youre making would be valid if we were talking about bridgerton or casting a black guy to play king henry v

50589,2,"/r/lotr",1,"> Lord of the rings is fundamentally based on Anglo-Saxon mythology.

No, that’s too narrow. I’ll give you “Northern European,” but frankly there *isn’t* enough existing Anglo-Saxon mythology for Tolkien to have based a world in it.

The Normans (deliberately or organically) obliterated most of the Anglo-Saxons’ mythology after they invaded.

That’s what Tolkien originally set out to “replace” with what would later become *The Silmarillion*.

To build Middle-Earth, he borrowed elements from similar or related folklores.

There’s more Norse mythology in there than anything else—the Dwarves in *The Hobbit* borrow a lot of names from the Poetic Edda, for example. That’s Old Norse via Iceland, not Anglo-Saxon. Dwarves in general are lifted almost straight from Norse mythology.

Tolkien’s trolls are lifted straight from Norse mythology, too.

Elves are a mix of old Germanic and Celtic. The Wood-Elves of Mirkwood in *The Hobbit* feel very reminiscent of the Irish Aos Si in a lot of ways.

But despite their Northern European roots, light skin is not an important feature of *any* of the Free Peoples of Middle-Earth.

I think the importance of minority representation in media tends to be overstated.

…But it certainly doesn’t *hurt* anything. It isn’t important to me that other ethnicities are represented…but it isn’t important to me that they’re *not*, either.

If it’s important to somebody else that their particular ethnicity appears on screen, then fine. Go ahead.

I don’t understand why that would matter so much to them, but that’s okay.

I don’t understand why someone would put pineapple on a pizza, either. But I don’t try to stop them.

22072,2,"/r/StarWars",0,"Ironically, a planet, even one the size of Ilum, getting close enough to drain a star of all its fuel (which, depending on the star, is either next to impossible or so over-the-top it's just stupid) would be *more* than enough to throw a planet out of orbit without needing to shoot its big honkin' space gun.  Its one of those things that breaks the Sequels for me.  I get the fantasy.  I like the fantasy.  Fantasy is all sorts of fun.  And suspending my disbelief is part of the fun.  

But this takes it a step too far.  Not the ability to do it, but the mindset of doing it.

See, if you have the capability of completing draining a star of its power....why do you need it to shoot a big gun?  Wouldn't it be more efficient to just, you know, knock a few planets out of orbit?  Or if you're really serious and you want everyone dead, use your ability to propel a planet through hyperspace to drag a giant meteor behind you and launch it toward a planet?  In theory, you don't need much and it's clear you can create a planet with a hyperdrive.  Why not make it smaller and launch a bunch of asteroids toward a star system?  Or just, you know, completely drain the sun of its fuel and watch while the entire star system's planets die in just a couple days as soon as the rays from the star stop reaching the planet?  I mean, you could do it just by positioning a big mirror in front of the planet to stop all light from reaching it.  If you have the technology to create Star Killer base in the first place...why do you need a weapon like Star Killer base?  Even better, you could just use that technology to create a black hole inside the planet like Star Trek.  Boom.  No planet.  Took less than 30 minutes, didn't require you destroying an entire sun (what a massive waste of resources, too), and the entire Republic now bends to your will because apparently only like 10 people think destroying an entire star system is worth fighting, even though previously, destroying *one* planet was more than enough to get like a billion people fighting against you.","ironically a planet even one the size of ilum getting close enough to drain a star of all its fuel which depending on the star is either next to impossible or so overthetop its just stupid would be more than enough to throw a planet out of orbit without needing to shoot its big honkin space gun  its one of those things that breaks the sequels for me  i get the fantasy  i like the fantasy  fantasy is all sorts of fun  and suspending my disbelief is part of the fun

Boba Fett was also another character whose story intersects with Mando. Does his story take over for an entire episode, leaving Mando out to twiddle his thumbs? No -- both characters are heavily involved in the episode, both pursuing their own goals.

When you bring an external character in, the focus of the episode should still remain on the main character. Hell, even the Bad Batch did it better -- while they had external characters like Rex and the Martez sisters come in, the Bad Batch remained deeply involved in those episodes.

I spun out on a back road during a snowstorm, and the truck going the other way saw. I was only freshly 17, and terrified. Not hurt, just shaken super bad. They immediately turned around and helped me out of my car, brought me to their friends place i (luckily lol) crashed in front of, and they let me call police for help.

Another time (again in winter, go figure) my mom and I were driving downstate through the adirondacks to see family for Thanksgiving. We were going slow, went to take a slow, slight bend in the road, and the car just kept going straight, and we ended up in the bank. A few minutes later a family in a van saw us and stopped. A young couple and their two young kids. The second they saw us they offered a ride to the nearest gas station with a phone. They really saved us, it was super dark out.

All she said was ""we've all been there, and we all need to eat. It's there anything else you'd like to grab?""

Tolkien didn't write fantasy he wrote myths? What does that even mean? The fantasy genre starts with Tolkien, everyone writing fantasy now is trying to write like Tolkien. When we say ""fantasy"" we mean ""like the lotr"".  Splitting hairs on the definitions of words is always suspect, doing so while totally ignoring how a word is actually used makes you look silly to anyone not up your butt already. 

No to mention the fact that Tolkien doesn't read like a mythical story. Anyone watch the green knight movie recently? That's a mythical story. They are very often nonsensical to the point of seeming childish. That is not how Tolkien wrote his epics, regardless of his motivations. 

And even if it he did write a myth, why would you approach a MYTH as if it were a historical document? Isn't that kinda backwards thinking? ""Well this myth said Maui lassoed the sun, we better show a rope traveling through space"" . 

And what credence does it lend to say you approached the book like a historical record? He wrote the script in the 90s. Anyone remember Braveheart? One of the most historically inaccurate films of all time that came out in the 90s. ""Oh you treated it like history? ...... So you basically just lifted the names then huh? Cool""

It was the most amazing thing that I had ever seen. Wizards! Dwarves! Goblins! Elves! A DRAGON!!!! It launched me, an already budding geek obsessed with Greek mythology, on a quest to find as many fantasy books as I could get my hands on.


(The animated **The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe**, which aired a few years later, sealed the deal. I was the first kid at my school library the next morning, and I grabbed the entire series without any shame.)


I received a boxed set of the trilogy+_The Hobbit_, the ones with the covers that used Tolkien's art, for Christmas when I was ten. I'd already read _The Hobbit_, (My first copy was an oversized one released to tie in with the animated movie, and had color pictures on every page) but had always been daunted by the size and density of the trilogy.



Finished them in less than a week, lent the set to a friend.  We started meeting up in the park to talk about it, eating ""lembas"" in the form of Drake's Coffee Cakes.  Warm flat coke was also consumed, because that made us think of the orc drink that was forced down Merry's throat.



We were weird kids.



But this, in the end, is why I'm not bothered by the various adaptations: I started with one of the worst, if you look at it objectively.  The blue-skinned elves alone! But it still had Tolkien's heart in it, and that was enough. Yeah, the books are better...but I'll never love them the way that I loved that movie as a 7 year old.

10901,2,"/r/StarWars",0,"Just seen The Book of Boba Fett finale.

Here are things I liked. The gang war kicks in and it becomes a crime drama I had hoped for. The Mando is great as always with him sticking to his teeth to repay his debt for Boba Fett. There is a jetpack scene that I couldn't believe they are doing it now at the finale. The Grogu reunion is adorable and I was worried if the series would go for the route of him staying with Luke. It turns out the showrunners made the right decision. Him using the Force to calm down the Rancor is another great moment. Cad Bane has charisma and could have been a great villain.

So let's talk about the cons. It's gonna be a list.

Out of the seven-episode season, there is only two-episode worth of the crime drama content. You can't shake off a feeling that all this is just rushed as hell. In the shows like Breaking Bad and Narcos, you can feel the brooding tension until the final confrontation becomes inevitable. Here, a third of the show is Boba flashbacks, the other third is The Mandalorian epilogue, and another third is actually devoted to the gang-related stuff. There is not sufficient build-up to make the battle cathartic. So what happens is the finale establishes too much because they failed to put in the work in making Mos Espa feel like a real place. They now have to explain the geography of Boba's assets and a bunch of the gang relations, and even after hearing it, I couldn't still figure out where the things were.

Outside of the Mando and Grogu, none of the side characters is memorable. The series so haphazardly sets up the cast of characters that I didn't give a shit who would live or die in the battle. Can anyone describe the unique quirks or personalities of the teenage bikers, Freetown people, the barkeeper, the clan bosses, the mayor, the comic relief Twi'lek secretary, the annoying mechanic lady, the Pike boss more than the surficial characterization? I can't. They are one-dimensional characters who have no depth--just robots to advance the plot. Even Cad Bane is lame as hell. Why wasn't he the main villain--an enforcer for the Pikes in the first place? He could have been a great foil to Boba, and there is a poignant dialogue between the two, but he gets introduced so late in the show to do any meaningful action. He doesn't do anything other than shoot at two people at Freetown. 

The gunfights are awful. I had a sneaking suspicion if Robert Rodriguez directed this one and watching the credits, yeah, I was right. There seems to be no storyboard, improvising shot to shot. One particular cinematography/editing confusion I noticed is, when normally you have good guys shooting at bad guys, you place good guys on the left side of the screen looking at right and place bad guys at the right side of the screen looking at left, so we don't get confused. This rule doesn't have to be kept all the time, but the majority of shots organized this way helps orient the audience. There is no consideration like this. For each cut, I had to reorient what I was looking at.

After the initial 'supposed' plan fails, the episode devolves into the two Mandalorians running out to the open area and right into the center of the snipers, being shot on from all sides, and only relying on their (plot) armors despite their armors not covering their entire bodies. None of them gets hurt. They literally have jetpacks and only use them once. No tactic, taking cover, using mobility, or anything. Actually, everyone's plot armor is so strong that the black Wookiee somehow survives from all those Pike lackeys? Did they just climb the Wookiee and not just... you know, shoot at him? He does get shot several times, but it has no effect on him at all. Everyone running in a straight line and no one gets shot by the massive droidekas. CGI looks awful here, a huge gap from how much looked great in the last episode. The crab droids and the Rancor look like the Prequel-level CGI. 

The actual plan to take down the Pike Syndicate is lackluster as hell. I was actually wondering, okay, there is no way Boba only takes 7 guys to take down hundreds of Pike gangs. He has to have another plan... it turns out, that's the plan. Mos Espa looks as if it has a population of at the very least five hundred thousand people, and Boba doesn't even care to recruit more. He really thinks he can control the lawless city full of criminals and various interests with barely over ten people. You can't even control Freetown with that number. Then he acts shocked that he is losing the war. There is a moment in which he rejects to go back to the palace and decides to use the destroyed cantina in the city so he can... fight for the people there...? Fight inside the city where civilian casualties and collateral damage are unavoidable??? Then he fucking rides a Rancor and goes full Godzilla on the city. What happened to ""I'm gonna rule the city by protecting people, earning them respect""? Does he want to save the city or not? What's funny is that this episode could have given him some sort of moral dilemma: should he use the Rancor and destroy the city to save the city? What's the lesser evil option here? No, the episode just ends with people cheering for him. HE DESTROYED MORE BUILDINGS THAN THE PIKES. 

Also, what's the point of bringing the massacre of the Tuskens up again? The Pike leader casually mentioning it to Cad Bane doesn't give it the weight the first four episodes have built up--especially when over half of those episodes were devoted to the Tusken flashbacks. When Boba hears it, he isn't all that distraught by the revelation. It doesn't change the plot in any way, shape, or form. Cad Bane tells it to Boba, which the show thinks it is setting up a rivalry between the two, but Cad Bane isn't the one who killed the Tuskens; Pikes did, so what's the point? Boba might have a personal vendetta against the Pikes, but it changes nothing. Hell, Fennec is the one who kills Pike leaders and the mayor. Again, why not have Boba kill them? As written in the show, Boba's motivation constantly shifts. He wants to retire, wants to be a boss, wants to have revenge on the Pikes, and now, it's ""these are my people"" as if he never spent years terrorizing Tatooinian civilians and working for their oppressors. The external conflict is solved, but I cannot tell what internal conflict is solved for him. He wins, and that's it. 

Mando and Fennec do everything. Din goes inside the shield and sets off bombs (why does anyone else never think of this?), Fennec kills the villains and pretty much ends the war. All the while Boba wrecks the town, killing hundreds of people including civilians, and lets the Rancor loose because Boba wants to ""rule with respect"". All this time staying in the bacta tank and thinking about if the bad guys need to be killed for over half of the series; the entire show could have been ended in the first episode if Boba told her to go and kill the Pike boss and the mayor. Actually, why does Fennec want to be loyal to Boba Fett? He constantly makes dumbass calls. She doesn't share interests other than Boba saving Fennec. They talk with each other barely. What's her agenda? What's the driving engine or desire of her character? What's stopping her from just killing Boba and taking the throne? 

To be fair, I can see Boba's ideal becoming popular, worthy of earning him the ruler of Mos Espa. Branding himself as a populist, Tatooine for Tatooine, no outside criminal influence from the galaxy, no spice dealings, providing real, proper jobs for people, and branding the Pikes as colonizers. Boba could have traveled around the galaxy and met some other conglomerates to improve the infrastructures and set up businesses there. Then people might ally with him and overthrow the mayor and Pikes. The Battle of Algiers (1966) but on Tatooine with civilians led by Boba waging guerilla warfare. That would have been amazing. But in the show, civilians have no way of knowing who Boba is or what his intentions are anyway. Boba never made a speech or spread propaganda to the people. He never announced anything to the public. It wasn't the 'people' who banded together for a higher ideal to overthrow the Pikes, it was just a bunch of biker kids, mercs, bounty hunters, and Freetown people who felt they were obligated to the Mando's request. The whole battle itself is ridiculous, but what's even dumber is there is nothing stopping the Pike Syndicate from invading Mos Espa again. They are one of the biggest criminal conglomerates and have set up their own establishments in thousands of systems. 

As written as it is, I cannot understand the creative decision behind the show. What does this show want to be? Is this show about how Boba survived from ROTJ, The Mandalorian epilogue, or Boba wanting to control Mos Espa? Disney, Favreau, Filoni, and Rodriguez made a show about a crimelord who does no crime, who has only seven followers and lives in a castle in the desert. There is no consistent vision other than making Boba Fett as a protagonist and bringing back a bunch of fan-favorite characters. I am floored.","just seen the book of boba fett finale

the gunfights are awful i had a sneaking suspicion if robert rodriguez directed this one and watching the credits yeah i was right there seems to be no storyboard improvising shot to shot one particular cinematographyediting confusion i noticed is when normally you have good guys shooting at bad guys you place good guys on the left side of the screen looking at right and place bad guys at the right side of the screen looking at left so we dont get confused this rule doesnt have to be kept all the time but the majority of shots organized this way helps orient the audience there is no consideration like this for each cut i had to reorient what i was looking at

after the initial supposed plan fails the episode devolves into the two mandalorians running out to the open area and right into the center of the snipers being shot on from all sides and only relying on their plot armors despite their armors not covering their entire bodies none of them gets hurt they literally have jetpacks and only use them once no tactic taking cover using mobility or anything actually everyones plot armor is so strong that the black wookiee somehow survives from all those pike lackeys did they just climb the wookiee and not just you know shoot at him he does get shot several times but it has no effect on him at all everyone running in a straight line and no one gets shot by the massive droidekas cgi looks awful here a huge gap from how much looked great in the last episode the crab droids and the rancor look like the prequellevel cgi 

the actual plan to take down the pike syndicate is lackluster as hell i was actually wondering okay there is no way boba only takes  guys to take down hundreds of pike gangs he has to have another plan it turns out thats the plan mos espa looks as if it has a population of at the very least five hundred thousand people and boba doesnt even care to recruit more he really thinks he can control the lawless city full of criminals and various interests with barely over ten people you cant even control freetown with that number then he acts shocked that he is losing the war there is a moment in which he rejects to go back to the palace and decides to use the destroyed cantina in the city so he can fight for the people there fight inside the city where civilian casualties and collateral damage are unavoidable then he fucking rides a rancor and goes full godzilla on the city what happened to im gonna rule the city by protecting people earning them respect does he want to save the city or not whats funny is that this episode could have given him some sort of moral dilemma should he use the rancor and destroy the city to save the city whats the lesser evil option here no the episode just ends with people cheering for him he destroyed more buildings than the pikes 

also whats the point of bringing the massacre of the tuskens up again the pike leader casually mentioning it to cad bane doesnt give it the weight the first four episodes have built upespecially when over half of those episodes were devoted to the tusken flashbacks when boba hears it he isnt all that distraught by the revelation it doesnt change the plot in any way shape or form cad bane tells it to boba which the show thinks it is setting up a rivalry between the two but cad bane isnt the one who killed the tuskens pikes did so whats the point boba might have a personal vendetta against the pikes but it changes nothing hell fennec is the one who kills pike leaders and the mayor again why not have boba kill them as written in the show bobas motivation constantly shifts he wants to retire wants to be a boss wants to have revenge on the pikes and now its these are my people as if he never spent years terrorizing tatooinian civilians and working for their oppressors the external conflict is solved but i cannot tell what internal conflict is solved for him he wins and thats it 

mando and fennec do everything din goes inside the shield and sets off bombs why does anyone else never think of this fennec kills the villains and pretty much ends the war all the while boba wrecks the town killing hundreds of people including civilians and lets the rancor loose because boba wants to rule with respect all this time staying in the bacta tank and thinking about if the bad guys need to be killed for over half of the series the entire show could have been ended in the first episode if boba told her to go and kill the pike boss and the mayor actually why does fennec want to be loyal to boba fett he constantly makes dumbass calls she doesnt share interests other than boba saving fennec they talk with each other barely whats her agenda whats the driving engine or desire of her character whats stopping her from just killing boba and taking the throne 

to be fair i can see bobas ideal becoming popular worthy of earning him the ruler of mos espa branding himself as a populist tatooine for tatooine no outside criminal influence from the galaxy no spice dealings providing real proper jobs for people and branding the pikes as colonizers boba could have traveled around the galaxy and met some other conglomerates to improve the infrastructures and set up businesses there then people might ally with him and overthrow the mayor and pikes the battle of algiers  but on tatooine with civilians led by boba waging guerilla warfare that would have been amazing but in the show civilians have no way of knowing who boba is or what his intentions are anyway boba never made a speech or spread propaganda to the people he never announced anything to the public it wasnt the people who banded together for a higher ideal to overthrow the pikes it was just a bunch of biker kids mercs bounty hunters and freetown people who felt they were obligated to the mandos request the whole battle itself is ridiculous but whats even dumber is there is nothing stopping the pike syndicate from invading mos espa again they are one of the biggest criminal conglomerates and have set up their own establishments in thousands of systems 

as written as it is i cannot understand the creative decision behind the show what does this show want to be is this show about how boba survived from rotj the mandalorian epilogue or boba wanting to control mos espa disney favreau filoni and rodriguez made a show about a crimelord who does no crime who has only seven followers and lives in a castle in the desert there is no consistent vision other than making boba fett as a protagonist and bringing back a bunch of fanfavorite characters i am floored"

13894,2,"/r/StarWars",0,"Quick quick thoughts, I'll give a bit more in depth thoughts later:  
1) Holy plot armor for our main characters. Fett, Dinn, Krssstan et all   
can take about a thousand blaster bolts. The Rancor can get blasted up   
front and upclose, stabbed, burned in his mouth, etc. (I'm a bit more ok  
 with the Rancor sustaining the injuries, than say the wookiee who just   
shrugs off about 30 blaster bolts and acts like it didn't do a damn   
thing to him  
2) I honestly never felt like actively rooting for bad guys before, but   
after seeing the ""In the Name of Honor"" as the episode title, and then   
seeing Fett/Din fight alone in the streets.... I was actively rooting   
for the Pykes because of the outlandish way I knew Fett and Co would win  
3) The battle felt.... repetitive and nonsensical at every turn. Its   
just a constant one upsmanship of people showing up. ""Oh you got   
that.... well I got this.... oh you got that.... I got this"" I never   
felt like any good guy was in any level of danger, and the parts with   
Sedaris for humor, drove that home even moreso. Because she's not   
getting killed, Grogu's not getting killed, Fett's not getting killed,   
Dinn's not getting killed, etc. I guess the only ""shock"" was that Cad   
Bane gets killed. But at this point, a) if you only watched this show,   
you have to wonder if he's the big bad, and b) he's only been in two   
episodes. For those who know Cad Bane, we know the character is old -   
like sixties plus minimum (legit not sure) we know they need some big   
death, so might as well be Bane here. Save him for the animated where he  
 looks better and is a lot less costly to use.  
4) Nothing felt earned. Nothing in this battle felt earned. It all felt   
contrived and just pointless. Holding out in Mos Espa, making it a big   
point that they stay in Mos Espa rather than the Palace, every character  
 has this special ability or can just ward off enemies, the droids can't  
 shoot fleeing people while only being 50 feet away, characters can take  
 40 shots to the face and survive, no one even makes smart choices. Good  
 guys and bad guys. If their holed up in one little building.... why not  
 just blow the freaking building up? This is Space 3000, you have   
infinite number of ways to do it. And they've already showed the bad   
guys to be without remorse or honor (ie. the terrorism act), so why not   
do it again? Why not send the Scorpion Droids first? And why even be   
running around them acting as targets (Pykes)?   
5) The episode devalued a lot of the previous episodes too. No Tuskens   
coming back. Cad Bane just uses the Tusken deaths as a way to try and   
goad Fett, so it shows that those flashbacks were primarily just for   
Fett's \[piss-poor\] ""character growth"", and not in anyway shape or form   
characters onto themselves other than plot vehicles. And to pad out this  
 show to 7 episodes. And thats including an entire Mandalorian episode   
in the mix. So many previous things just had a 5 second call back that   
got utilized here in the final, and was made to show ""see how things   
progress, like shows and real life do?!"" but it was all basically just   
done in the service of the idea. Hutts were a small obstacle... and they  
 just convinently left the Giant wookiee and Rancor for Fett that he   
ended up using on the Pykes. And this is why nothing feels earned. They   
check-marked things. ""Episode 1 he gets this, we'll use it in the   
finale"",  ""Episode 2 he gains this character, he'll use him in the   
finale"", etc. Which makes SENSE in storytelling, if its given gravitas   
and shown for more than 5 seconds. Like the Rancor, here it is, a gift,   
Fett rubs his face, says I want to ride it.... and lo and behold he   
comes in saving the day riding a Rancor.... whoever guessed that was   
gonna happen.... but we never see a single bit of progression with it   
other than free toy used. Same as Krrssstan, we don't see him really   
other than a Free Toy given and used. Him and Fett have no real scenes   
until halfway through this battle where Fett says, I'll give you a bacta  
 tank nap.  
   
6) Fennec Shand in this episode. Her entire attack on the head of the   
Syndicate feels once again - unearned/undeserved/too easy. If it was   
that simple to take out the entire head of the syndicate + mayor +   
turncoats. Why couldn't this have been done from the beginning? And she   
clearly doesn't care about stabbing in the back/shooting in the   
back/lynching, so its not even an honor thing. They could have just used  
 her to assassinate them at anytime. (Well, I guess the Twi'lek   
Majordomo only reveals that at the beginning of this episode, but once   
again, feels like an unearned bit of information, because you don't even  
 see her get there onscreen or anything. He gives her info, she goes,   
'ok, off I go to assassinate an entire building and single handedly win   
this war' derp de derp, hold the fort while I'm gone Mr. Boba.)  
7) After credit scene. Thank goodness we know that Cobb was in the bacta  
 tank, with the modder, and will live. Once again showing how little   
peril there is for any main character in this show. ""Take 50 shots to   
the face? Don't worry. Bacta Tank. But its only for good guys! So no Cad  
 Bane getting to use it!""  
8) Sadly, I'm not even satisfied by the ending and where the characters   
stand afterwards. Ok, so at the end, we have Dinn off with Grogu having   
adventures again, and its shown off screen that Grogu made the decision   
to leave the training \[shocker\]. (Also, does this mean R2 is completely   
able to fly the X-Wing back to Luke, or does it still need some kind of   
life form on board?) Fett, Shand, and his merry band are now running Mos  
 Espa / Eisley / Tatooine? Do we see Fett do more in the future, and if   
so in what capacity, and why would he now leave Tatooine? Was this   
really even enough to persuade the Pykes to leave Tatooine? Why were the  
 Pykes really there in the first place? Why are they bringing Spice from  
 Kessel to Tatooine and then to do what with it? What will Fett do as   
leader of Tatooine? How does he really benefit the people other than   
running out drug dealers?","quick quick thoughts ill give a bit more in depth thoughts later

13857,2,"/r/StarWars",0,"Spy kids in space. I am disappoint. Once again proving the point that the biggest problem with this series is the involvement of a certain director.

The cheesy dialogue on the outros, and mando hitting the boost had the same vibe as the Flash/Superman race at the end of the justice league that shall not be named.

Every action scene felt clunky, poorly choreographed, and illogical (Fennecs magically appearing speeder, “Santo” appearing out of nowhere as well, and fk I can’t stress it enough FK those vespas and anyone involved with them.)

The random switching between lighting in shots was disorientating, and the plot armour was thrones tier, now literally anyone can just pop back as cyborg, someone tell Palpatine for fks sake he just needs to get Cyberpunk Dreadlocks (I refuse to learn any of the mods names) on retainer.

Especially seeing Boba and Din struggle given what they had to fight last season.

Cad Bane might be the only saving grace, and 60% of that is just from his voice.

Also way to completely waste the emotional payoff of the Reunion.

She basicly now tweets about characters sexualities and claims to have written in some hidden overarching social commentary, which in some cases actually may be the case but in others one can clearly tell she just wants to keep herself relevant and pander to the weirdo crowd who actually care about Dumbledore being gay and all that shit. It's weird, since she clearly had some great things in mind but her success seems to relly have gotten to her head and now she desperately tries to keep herself relevant, instead of just accepting that Harry Potter is a beloved series she could expand on with new books or other stories instead of making micro-changes that just piss fans off due to being unnecessary. Also, she goes hard against ""the patriarchy"" which may have been a good cause in the 1700s and in some countries even as far as the 1980s and 90s but in todays world it is a bit weird to talk about ""the patriarchy"" and fighting against it, especially if you are one of the worlds most famous female authors, whose books have inspired millions if not billions of people. 


With GoT I meant the general treatment of fans and their treatment of stories and arcs they had set up and of course the weird ""girl power"" moments they included that sometimes were out of character and other times just stole epic moments from other characters.


To address two franchises I forgot:
With Marvel and DC I really dont care much, since I really like some changes they made but the newer ones get worse and worse, especially those ""girl power"" moments... as if we didn't think black widow was a badass before she posed with all the other women and said ""men bad women good"". Or as if we didn't think Scarlet Witch has epic abilities before showing up and doing the stuff ""men cant do"". For DC, the changes they make get drowned out by the awful storytelling that some movies just suffer majorly from and in most cases I cant be upset when someone simply cant act... at that point the changes are irrelevant, since there are different problems at hand. Also those have at least a good explanation why they are diverse, dince they take place in modern day america - although that one black soldier fighting for hydra seemed a bit weird, especially if it is supposed to be 1945s germany...



It is a general trend we see in modern media, which is sad, since the old way of including commentary gets throen out of the window and good stories get sidelined to shove some message into the audiences faces. My main problem with that is, that it doesn't really do anything. I mean, if you are a sexist, racist and an overall asshole for like 40 years of your life, then you wont change your entire personality and way of life because you saw some action chick do cool stuff or see a black guy being a badass. Also, if you hate gay folks, then you will still hate fay folks after seeing them in a movie.

42594,2,"/r/lotr",1,"Let me see if I understand some of these core arguments here. It’s important that we make alterations to one of the most epic fantasy settings ever primarily so that non-white actors can find work in it? We don’t have more shows like this for people of African or Asian descent because they just aren’t being written by Hollywood? Obviously there are many Asian epics out there (Red Cliff comes to mind) they are just made in China for primarily Chinese audiences. As far as I am aware there aren’t really any epic African war/fantasy movies on the same scale as this or say Troy for the western tradition. 

So the question here is for me, which audience of the world needs to see these films? It would seem that representation is important for non-whites to see people that look like them in positions of power and prestige, as well as for white people to help break racial stereotypes they have of those minorities. For many years it was primarily white actors in these leading roles which consciously or subconsciously does help solidify white cultural hegemony in the West (specifically America). 

So what is the underlying purpose behind greater diversity in American made films then? To make non-whites more accepted and supported by our media which helps inform our perceptions of the world and who ought to be influential in it, but most specifically in America or the West since Asia has a much more racial homogeneous media vis-a-vis Japan and China. 

Basically how it comes across when hearing many of these arguments for better or worse is this. There are many myths and stories from across the world that should be told so that we have an opportunity to celebrate the different histories and cultures of the world and the roles should be filled by people that best reflect that background (e.g Shang-chi, Red Cliff, Black Panther) but due to Hollywood whitewashing of the previous decades where white people have inserted themselves into different worlds so that white audiences could see themselves in the role, it’s only right that non-white actors play roles so that non-whites can have characters they feel they can see themselves in for stories that are set in a European or white backdrop. So it’s a type of moral course correction where we need to make up for the years of white insert characters by having non-white insert characters for the non-white audience to have an easier time connecting to the story. 

For me I totally agree with the goal that is trying to be accomplished, I just think the way many modern interpretations go about it is just lazy and hollow and doesn’t really celebrate the cultural differences or elevate ethnicities that I love to learn about as a avid reader of history. It comes across as we shouldn’t see race anymore, rather than learning to appreciate our differences. 

But that’s enough rambling for me :)","let me see if i understand some of these core arguments here its important that we make alterations to one of the most epic fantasy settings ever primarily so that nonwhite actors can find work in it we dont have more shows like this for people of african or asian descent because they just arent being written by hollywood obviously there are many asian epics out there red cliff comes to mind they are just made in china for primarily chinese audiences as far as i am aware there arent really any epic african warfantasy movies on the same scale as this or say troy for the western tradition

“Before the crossing of the mountains the Hobbits had already become divided into three *slightly* separate breeds: Harfoots, Stoors, and Fallohides. The Harfoots were browner of skin, smaller, and shorter, and they were beardless and bootless; their feet and hands were larger; and they preferred highlands and hillsides.” He said they were browner, not African, Asian, or Maori. And it is proven even more by how the Shire is meant to be an idyllic pre industrial rural England, and it later goes on to say they are the most prominent of the groups that went west into Eriador. And earlier he describes the hobbits as being “red-cheeked”.

45871,2,"/r/lotr",1,"Are you an adult? You haven't convinced me.

>Making dwarves black disconnects them from the myths they are inspired from. You choose to ignore skin colour by your standard, for others skin colour is as important as other physical features.

Yes, I choose what I care about. So do you. For me, skin color is immaterial to the lore, and to the narrative. It certainly is less of a concern when compared to dwarven height, which is a characteristic assigned to the entire race. But \*even if\* Tolkien declared that all elves were white and all dwarves white and all elves white, I'd still say, ""let's get rid of that part right there - that part is a bit ugly, given the world we live in"".

>Nice strawman

I accepted that we could make the female dwarves beardless, and I stated that it wouldn't affect the narrative, despite it being my preference. I then asked you if you thought it would? Can you explain to me how this is a strawman? 

>And your argument goes both ways. How blackwashing dwarves and elves is important to the story? It is not.

Right? So they can be any skin color. We are in agreement.

>Imagined. If it goes against, established aesthetics of the show, they shouldn't be there.

Bakshi established the ""aesthetics"" of LotR as much as Jackson, and before that it would have been the descriptions in the books, which are interpreted by each reader in their own cultural context. I didn't grow up in the English countryside, but the the ""aesthetics"" of the Shire were immediately recognizable to me. Who established them other than myself? Tolkien?

How does a Chinese boy reading The Hobbit in Mandarin imagine the characters inside? As white Europeans? Does he find rice paddies in his Shire? Did Tolkien ever say there weren't rice paddies in the Shire?

>And don't try to use the oppressed tactic on me.

Ok, snowflake. I'm sure it is easy for you to wave away the very real and ongoing aftereffects of systemized chattel slavery and colonialism, but for some people, it's still very real.

> I am pro equality, not equity

Right, that old chestnut. Please expound on that. It sounds like the old, ""equality of opportunity, not outcome"", but I hope that's not what you are going to argue.

>And when there is a movie solely dedicated to bearded women, I will not make demands or criticize that movie for the lack of representation of non-bearded women.

As it happens, the dominant group doesn't care to make those types of movies, and they don't want bearded people in non-bearded stories (unless its just in the way that they dictate, as you are doing now), and the non-bearded people still largely control the industries that produce movies. Is that changing? Yes, and PoC characters in LotR is evidence of that positive trend.

>Some works require black only cast: Empire, Black Panther. Some works require white only cast: Lotr, Vikings.

This is why I think you are immature (probably not a child? but arguing like one). Vikings is historical fiction. LotR is \*not\* historical. It is not Europe. The people inside did not evolve from an ape-like humanoid ancestor that in turn evolved from some ""lesser"" lifeform. They do not need DNA and they require no explanation for skin color based on melanin or anything else. The physics of Arda are at times insane and nonsensical. But sure, get worked up over how the skin color doesn't make sense. That's not revealing about you at all.

The concept of who and who is not white is not fixed. It's completely made-up. 100 years ago, you might have argued against Jews as being considered white. Two hundred years ago, the Irish and Italians may have been excluded from the story. Whiteness was created for the purpose of maintaining the system of slavery in response to the conversion of African slaves to Christianity. They needed a new way to create an in-group/out-group that wasn't based on Africans as heathens, so they just made it up. Then they justified it with philosophy, and natural sciences, and the only legacy you are protecting here is \*that\* one. Not Tolkien's. Just the ugly legacy of racism. What a way to spend your time.","are you an adult you havent convinced me

making dwarves black disconnects them from the myths they are inspired from you choose to ignore skin colour by your standard for others skin colour is as important as other physical features

yes i choose what i care about so do you for me skin color is immaterial to the lore and to the narrative it certainly is less of a concern when compared to dwarven height which is a characteristic assigned to the entire race but even if tolkien declared that all elves were white and all dwarves white and all elves white id still say lets get rid of that part right there  that part is a bit ugly given the world we live in

nice strawman

i accepted that we could make the female dwarves beardless and i stated that it wouldnt affect the narrative despite it being my preference i then asked you if you thought it would can you explain to me how this is a strawman 

and your argument goes both ways how blackwashing dwarves and elves is important to the story it is not

right so they can be any skin color we are in agreement

imagined if it goes against established aesthetics of the show they shouldnt be there

bakshi established the aesthetics of lotr as much as jackson and before that it would have been the descriptions in the books which are interpreted by each reader in their own cultural context i didnt grow up in the english countryside but the the aesthetics of the shire were immediately recognizable to me who established them other than myself tolkien

how does a chinese boy reading the hobbit in mandarin imagine the characters inside as white europeans does he find rice paddies in his shire did tolkien ever say there werent rice paddies in the shire

and dont try to use the oppressed tactic on me

ok snowflake im sure it is easy for you to wave away the very real and ongoing aftereffects of systemized chattel slavery and colonialism but for some people its still very real

 i am pro equality not equity

right that old chestnut please expound on that it sounds like the old equality of opportunity not outcome but i hope thats not what you are going to argue

and when there is a movie solely dedicated to bearded women i will not make demands or criticize that movie for the lack of representation of nonbearded women

as it happens the dominant group doesnt care to make those types of movies and they dont want bearded people in nonbearded stories unless its just in the way that they dictate as you are doing now and the nonbearded people still largely control the industries that produce movies is that changing yes and poc characters in lotr is evidence of that positive trend

some works require black only cast empire black panther some works require white only cast lotr vikings

How PJ's LOTR could turn out to be the masterpiece it is now held to be, I'm sure those initial detractors couldn't have predicted.","as i said we know what they have the rights to what we dont know is what they have permission to use on a case by case basis with permission from the estate and there is a reasonable basis to conclude there is some of that going on

my point is that the people involved in the show wont limit their personal research to what amazon has the rights to there is decent evidence for this personally i recall seeing an ig post from an actor containing a copy of the silmarillion it is without doubt relevant to point out that we simply dont know yet just how each and every contributors perspectives will impact the final product potentially in ways that imply knowledge of this additional material

37486,2,"/r/lotr",1,"Friend, there’s only one thing you need to know. Up until Bree, Tolkien was fighting with himself and with his publishers whether or not this was going to be *Hobbit 2 - The Sequel* or not. He didn’t know where the story was going at all. So he wrote a travellogue of four merry friends and their adventures in the Shire, mostly for his own amusement.

The second Tolkien found Strider, and once Tolkien realized Strider was a man (he was a Hobbit at first), the story **exploded** in his head. After Bree, and especially after Rivendell, the style and speed of the story change *dramatically*. In fact, if you’re a fast reader, you can almost read the novels parallel to the movies and finish at around the same time. Almost. The Lord of the Rings, *after Bree*, is not, like many say, a slow book. Not even remotely. The Lord of the Rings, after Bree, is a thunderstorm. 

And that’s sad and amazing. 

Sad, because it prevents so many readers from experiencing this incredible novel, who usually give up around the time the Barrow Downs come around, and then go online and perpetuate the myth of ‘Tolkien, who spends ages writing about trees and leaves’ and his supposedly slow book.

Amazing, because going back to those chapters after you’ve finished the book once is so incredibly warming and pleasant. It’s one of the reasons this book has endured for so long, and likely the reason Tolkien’s publishers didn’t cut it all out: The Lord of the Rings just gets better and better with every subsequent read. And getting to spend all that time in the Shire is a big part of it.

the hard decision grogu had to make was completely skipped 

for an all action episode im sorry but i dont know what it is about robert rodriguez but hes not very good like the group of freetown people and the spy kids running in a group down the street getting shot at nothing is very tactical bit of a mess i do not want him doing more episodes which is weird because his episode in mando season  was awesome"

All save one. There waiting, silent and still in the space before the Gate, sat Gandalf upon Shadowfax: Shadowfax who alone among the free horses of the earth endured the terror, unmoving, steadfast as a graven image in Rath Dínen.
""You cannot enter here,"" said Gandalf, and the huge shadow halted. ""Go back to the abyss prepared for you! Go back! Fall into the nothingness that awaits you and your Master. Go!""
The Black Rider flung back his hood, and behold! he had a kingly crown; and yet upon no head visible was it set. The red fires shone between it and the mantled shoulders vast and dark. From a mouth unseen there came a deadly laughter.
""Old fool!"" he said. ""Old fool! This is my hour. Do you not know Death when you see it? Die now and curse in vain!"" And with that he lifted high his sword and flames ran down the blade.

And in that very moment, away behind in some courtyard of the city, a cock crowed. Shrill and clear he crowed, recking nothing of war nor of wizardry, welcoming only the morning that in the sky far above the shadows of death was coming with the dawn.
And as if in answer there came from far away another note. Horns, horns, horns, in dark Mindolluin's sides they dimly echoed. Great horns of the north wildly blowing. Rohan had come at last.

50785,2,"/r/lotr",1,"I disagree, Disney is making mad bank on this exploitative formula. 

Have any of their live actions been objectively good other than Cinderella and the first Maleficent?

A lot of them are straight up aggressively awful, like Beauty and the Beast, Aladin and the second and third Star Wars reboots. 

They are still making bank, and regardless of how bad the products are, people won't stop consuming them. You say the Star Wars movies weren't profitable, but look at the box office numbers.

They've focus grouped it to death realizing that this ""culture war"" bullshit is highly profitable. I'm extremely left, and I'm saying this bc I see the mega corp TM for what it is. I don't believe the company literally being charged for racially segregating employees by race, and charged with rampant misogyny gives a shit about representation.

They KNOW they're pissing off their entrenched fan bases, but also KNOW that the fans are going to predominantly watch anyways. They don't care, bc they already know they have that group in pocket anyways.

They're deliberately making moves via faux woketivism by trying to intentionally generate controversy. Why? They're trying to get an audience that wouldn't otherwise consume the media to do so as a ""teams politics"" statement. 

I KNOW that they're not doing this genuinely, otherwise movies like Mulan, Black Panther or Shang-Chi would have had diverse casting. Not just pointing out the monogamous races in these movies, but the lack of LGBTQ+ rep, religious rep, social justice advocacy (just... everything wrong with shooting Mulan in the province where the Uighur concentration camps are and knowing that the outsourced labour is being fulfilled by that slave labour) highlights they don't actually care if it's not profitable.

That's also why they are constantly treating actors from marginalized groups, esp. women of colour as disposable. The actress that played Rose in the new starwars movies was harrased and doxxed non-stop with what was equivalent to a green stop sign put up by Disney for example  look at how Netflix has treated the marginalized actors from Cowboy Bebop, and the Witcher.

These adaptations are chronically bad, bc they know they can get away with being bad. The money and effort goes into producing, and advertising. The rest is a hollow, shitty CGI fest that reads like bad fan fiction that undercuts the intent, themes, stories etc. of the source material. 

Think back to how desperately people defended the fem ghost buster remake. Think about how bad and low quality it was. That didn't read to me as a passion project. Ghost Busters fan largely watched it begrudgingly, and people who felt they were ""showing the sexists"" went to go watch it when they wouldn't have otherwise.

The only way to end this shit is to not engage with it. Don't pay for it. Don't defend it. All groups deserve better representation than these table scraps, and there needs to be a conversation about how the only media created for marginalized groups is so few and far between that it has groups fighting this hard for table scraps in the first place.","i disagree disney is making mad bank on this exploitative formula

51227,2,"/r/lotr",1,"> No Im under the impression that fair skin can become quite tan and dark with just a decade

That isn't really how that works. There's a ""maximum"" to tan-ness, if you will. Melanin is produced by melanocytes, and both their quantity, as well as ""quality"" - the amount of melanin they are capable to produce - differs in people dependent on their ancestry. There's even a mutation of some gene that is prevalent in Northern and North-Western Europe that causes a disruption of melanogenesis. I can't quite recall in detail how that happens, but anyway, the result is that those people can't tan at all and their skin just burns and peels. 

But none of that would change ones ethnicity. If there *are* elves with, in modern terms, significant African admixture, they'd have been made like that. 

Within the context of Eä, the elves significantly predate the sun. They awoke in darkness, as the Silmarillion tells us. And the sun was literally made from the last fruit of the tree Laurelin, after it was spoiled by Melkor. I'm not sure how that relates to humans tanning.

> Elves are already known to be malleable considering Melkor twisted elves to turn them into orcs. If Melkor can turn pale elves into orcs then I dont see how its such a stretch to think the sun could make an elf basically just normal but tanner over hundreds or thousands of years.

That's an enormous stretch. But firstly, of course the actor playing the elf is ""normal"". That's not how I categorise people, as ""normal"" (i.e. white) and ""not normal"". I'm sure you don't, either, but that's a strange way to put it. The actor playing the dark-skinned elf isn't ""white but tan"". 

With that said, Melkor is nearly a god in his own right, mightiest of the Valar. The sun is a glowing fruit. I'm not saying ""elves can't tan"". I don't know if they can. Elves don't suffer diseases. They are magically immortal. You could probably argue  that they are generally impervious to external influence that is not caused by moral agents (i.e. Morgoth or Sauron can twist elves in appearances or mind, but not viruses or bacteria - or the sun), but that's extremely speculative.

Meaning he's that type of writer, he writes the same way and really has that same ""heart"" in his works. I used to read a TON of fanfiction in my younger years and write a good bit of it myself, I'm familiar with the flaws of those kinds of writers. Filoni's great at ""getting"" the world of Star Wars, but he needs to stop being so personally attached to his characters. 

>Star Wars has always been about the characters since the start.

Exactly, we see Luke and Han's arc, their character growth, progress, relationships and actions fill out what we know as the Original Trilogy of Star Wars films. 

It's hard to describe, and they both feed into each other, but a pretty easy way to illustrate is don't weaken a story or a story's impact just so you can have a character you like show up again. Everything a character does needs to be for the good of the story, and if you can get that right, everything else will follow. It doesn't have to be some huge, entangled, complicated plot.

For example: a ton of people (myself included), think Ahsoka making it out of Twilight of the Apprentice, especially since there was no real way out of that, was a huge blow to the significance of her and Vader's encounter, the tension of the show in general, their arcs as characters and the type of person she is (throwing herself into danger for the sake of her friends, the old sacrificing herself for the new generation), and also keeps begging the question on where she is in the OT. But because Filoni can't bear to see anything bad happen to her, she lives (and almost damn near breaks the universe with the World between Worlds shenanigans to justify it) and it all ends up being a nothingburger.","fanfiction is noncanon fiction written by fans not professional writers hired by the studio to make more content so i dont really understand that statement
