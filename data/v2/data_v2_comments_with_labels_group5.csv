Jackson is an outlier. Asimov is an outlier. They're not _normal_.

>People who are not white are as much a part of Britain/northern Europe/US as any white person

Flawed statement. People have *ethnic* ties to areas of the world, this is why it makes no sense to use the term ""white"" here (not an ethnicity) or talk about huge swathes of land like ""northern Europe"" or the US. People who are ethnically from an area do have more of a connection to it than people who don't.  

>Yes they(not white people) deserve to be able to get acting jobs

Flawed statement again. They (nonwhite people) are already getting acting jobs, it's a complete non-sequitur to say that adaptations of works with mostly white characters must be changed because otherwise nonwhites can't get acting jobs. Unless this show is the only TV production in existence, that makes no sense.

>they deserve to be able to see people who look like them on TV

Final flawed statement. To single out a group, blacks are already *over*represented on TV in both the US and UK. To argue that white characters in this adaptation *need* to be blackwashed because otherwise black people will be underrepresented on TV is already a lie. If you actually cared about representation, you'd be arguing there should be less black people on tv and more hispanic people (particularly in the US very underrepresented). You don't care about representation though, but you'd likely throw a fit if an adaptation of Mulan was full of white people, I wonder why.

And of course you drag out the tired line at the end, where wanting a faithful adaptation of source material is racist because the people in it would be mostly white. I'm beginning to think this conversation has far more to do with what you think about white people than Tolkien.

A few things:

\- Cad Bane should've been in the show from the first episode. It should've been a growing rivalry where we continue to see Bane be a complete god tier villian. (instead the introduced him at the end of last episode and killed him at the end of this episode \*\*Yes Ik he may not be dead dead but still bad writing, if I hadn't seen Clone Wars this would've been SO weird.\*\*)

\- The show should've focused more on Boba growing older and possibly being off his edge. That way, instead of us watching him struggle in every fight and being like ""Wtf is this stupid action?"" it made sense and added more weight. That at the very very end we can see Boba struggling in his fight, knocked down, Bane approaching, and when he wins it feels like a major triumph. Instead of Boba just losing every fight, needing help and then finally remembering he is not an idiot.

\- The Spy Kids shit needs to go. So out of place in Star Wars.

\- I guess i'm fine with Vanth surviving.

\- So.... The end of Mando S2, with Grogu going to Luke is just... undone. Back to Adventures with Kid! I thought at least \*something\* interesting would occur with Luke being like ""Okay fine take both, no attachments was the old jedi way and stupid. I loved my father and that love brought peace to the galaxy."" but nah... just ""Here's the kid back""

\- Why was Mando holding Grogu to his chest IN A WARZONE!!>!>!?!?!

\- I personally would like to see Grogu age up. I understand he likely won't for a while, and I get why. But for story purposes I'm kinda tired of 2/4 major enemies in this episode being taken out by a cutesy little child holding his hand out. (droid 1 & rancor.. droid 2 & cad)

\- I know the darksaber stuff will be elaborated on way more in the next Mando season but it really just felt like he did nothing with it the entire show.. Episode 5 was very cool with him and it tho

\- Why did they need to fight in the middle of the city to protect the citizens? Were the Pikes going to start murdering innocents? that hardly makes any sense. Pulling the action away would be far better for the population.

\- Mando willing to die for Boba was cool (and I get somewhere it could be ""I don't have my Mando group anymore, and I don't have Grogu so why not die) but that plot point needed FAR MORE emphasize, it was super odd Mando just being like ""Yup okay i'll die""

\- I am 10000% convinced you could've shot this episode with the same script and different director and it would've been 1000x better. The action of them never taking cover, barely ever taking high ground, and being constantly caught in the same area firing back and forth was so horribly done and took a lot of tension out.

\- Rancor entrance and fight scenes were cool enough I suppose.

\- Running away in a straight line with no cover in open streets.... okay.

\- So they finally took time to answer the question I've been wondering this entire series. Why Boba wants to be a Crime Lord on Tatooine... anddddd ""This is my city""..... are you fucking kidding me? How does that make any sense? Become the Sheriff then... the MAYOR! Not the fucking crime lord.... His motivation for that job was so dumb. Also... at the end does he give up the position??? Because of the respect he earned?!?!? Like... the fighting 1000 enemies wasn't what did it... it was the BOWING TO PEOPLE that got Boba to realize he doesn't want the job.

Anyways, some real nitpick stuff in my comments, but I think this show suffered massively on the directing front, not having a major focus, being all over the place.","welp the show certainly ended

""Books written decades ago"" is underhanded as hell and a poor attempt at shutting down criticism. The last book came out in 2011 or 2012 and a huge whack of the series came out in the 2000s and the series has always been widely lauded for the sheer number of strong female characters, many of whom top fan polls as the favourite character.

And in Shibboleth: ""she fought fiercely against Feanor in defence of her mother's kin."" Note that she wasn't the only female fighter at Alqualondë. Since we are told: ""indeed in dire straits or desperate defence the Nissi \[the Elf-women\] fought valiantly"" - Laws and Customs  

But the difference between Galadriel and other Nissi was that she wasn't only brave, but she was also a leader and Amazon.

""Galadriel, the fairest lady of the house of Finwë and the most valiant."" - Morgoth's Ring

""She was called Nerwen ‘man-maiden’ because of her strength and stature, and her courage."" - Nature of Middle-earth

""Galadriel the Valiant and Fair"" -  Morgoth's Ring. 

 ""\[Galadriel\] was then of Amazon disposition and bound up her hair as a crown when taking part in athletic feats” - Tolkien Letter 348  

“\[Éowyn\] was also not really a soldier or ‘amazon’, but like many brave women was capable of great military gallantry at a crisis.” - The Letters of JRR Tolkien, Letter #244 

 The only women in Tolkien who are described as 'amazon' are Haleth (the warrior Queen/Chieftain of Haladin), the early versions of Eowyn in History of Lord of the Rings (she openly goes to war in those versions as opposed to the final version where she wasn't Amazon), Makar's sister the Valie/Goddess of War (from the Book of Lost Tales) and Galadriel. Tolkien translated the word Amazon into ""Gothwin"" in Elvish, but the literal translation of Gothwin is ""War Woman"".  

In Second Age Galadriel was one of the war leaders of Eregion in the War of the Elves and Sauron. In the early versions Galadriel is not present in Eregion during the war (she was in Lorien), and it's her husband and Celebrimbor (and later Elrond) only who lead the armies of Eregion: ""The scouts and vanguard of Sauron's host were already approaching when Celeborn made a sortie and drove them back; but though he was able to join his force to that of Elrond...."" - Unfinished Tales

But in later essays and notes Galadriel is there right side-by-side with Celeborn: “Galadriel and Celeborn, and their followers, who after the destruction of Eregion passed through Moria” “Galadriel and Celeborn only retreated thither \[to Lorien\] after the downfall of Eregion."" “After the Fall of Eregion... They had passed through Moria with considerable following of Noldorin Exiles and dwelt for many years in Lorien” In Eregion Galadriel and Celeborn took part ""in its defence against Sauron""

Above quotes are from Parma Eldalamberon 17 and Nature of Middle-earth.","dictionary would literally tell you that leading your host in a battlefield means you are commanding an army 

galadriels quarrel with the sons of fëanor at sack of alqualondë how she fought  nature of middleearth  

note that the event of fighting at alqualonde itself is described as a quarrel by tolkien thrice the folk of feanor were driven back and many were slain upon either side but the vanguard of the noldor were succoured by fingon with the foremost people of fingolfin these coming up found a battle joined and their own kin falling and they rushed in ere they knew rightly the cause of the quarrel some deemed indeed that the teleri had sought to waylay the march of the noldor at the bidding of the valar

"142",48708,5,"/r/lotr",1,"Honestly, it was a shock for a few days but then life went on. If you didn’t have family or friends that were directly impacted, you just followed the news and people were on tv pontificating about how there were “great evils” in the world we needed to fight but you mostly ignored it. 

Obviously it still dominated the news but we didn’t sit around watching the news 24 hours a day. There were way bigger turnouts at blood drives for a few weeks after. That’s about it. 

It maybe came up once a week in conversation. If that. I didn’t know anyone personally involved so at the time the thought was that it would blow over. 

Two months later came the invasion of Afghanistan. It was marketed as a swift, surgical military action to extradite bin Laden and stabilize the Taliban supply lines. We were hearing all this news about how badly the civilian population lived under them, and there was a lot of talk about international humanitarian aid and giving those people better lives. All of which would be achieved in a couple months of course. 

So we thought, “OK great humanitarian intervention, plus swift decisive action and we get justice for 9/11 so soon we can all move on”. I remember considering dropping out of college temporarily just so I could enlist and be part of a humanitarian aid force. Fortunately my mom convinced me otherwise. 

Then Bush redirected all of this back to Iraq, and the UN weapons inspector thing had been going on since the summer. Really it was just kind of a minor annoyance that the UN inspectors were getting some pushback, they had cooperation just not as much as they wanted, they didn’t feel like it was that big of a deal but Bush jumped on it. And there was no support behind it until 9/11, after that the hawks  were getting louder and there was something wrong with you if you spoke against them. 

It was really not until mid 2002 when things started looking bad.  Bush failed to get a UN resolution to invade Iraq, but he started really harping on 9/11 as justification for the US to do it on our own. And we had scary things like the vice president talking on national tv about how he supported torture in order to get confessions. It felt like over the next 2 to 3 years there was some sort of cultural shift - because as long as what we were doing good in some conceivable way be justified with 9/11 that we could  do no wrong. 

But it really took a couple years to settle in. For the first few months things felt pretty normal and aside from the tragedy of the lives lost no one else was really affected. Travel felt weird but mostly it felt like the people who were supposed to prevent this kind of thing fucked up, people died and it was horrible, but people died all around the world from things in the 90’s and we would hear about it in the news and say “Aw that’s awful” and then move on with life.","honestly it was a shock for a few days but then life went on if you didnt have family or friends that were directly impacted you just followed the news and people were on tv pontificating about how there were great evils in the world we needed to fight but you mostly ignored it

I think the biggest factor of inclusion increasing in the entertainment industry is directly tied to the success of the MCU and the changing of Ike Pulmutter as CEO to Kevin Feige.

Ike was the former head of the toy division at marvel. When he became CEO at the beginning of the Marvel movie push he wanted the movies to focus on what he saw as the highest source of revenue.

Selling toys to kids. Specifically the largest toy buying market. Young white males.

When Kevin feige took over it all changed. Gone was the focus of selling toys and gone with the audience focus being young white males.

This was also about the same time that Marvel movies grew up and were no longer so childish and cartoony.

According to LEGO designers and employees of a model company, Disney directed them to call it Boba Fett's Starship instead of Slave I. All merch/appearances since around April 2021 only call it Firespray/Boba Fett's Starship/Starfighter

The databank was updated around then and Slave I was removed from the url and description, but stayed as the official name - *Disney will most likely not change the name*

They *are*, however, *not using it*. It may relate to future story moments, it may be marketing, no one really knows but Disney right now

It's also likely only called Firespray in BOBF due to them avoiding the name (my own speculation is either Disney not wanting the name said, or it will be renamed postROTJ to make clear ""which"" Boba people are talking about)

Fennec would also likely know what Slave I is given she knew who Boba (the most famous bounty hunter) was. It's unlikely the writers thought about her in-universe knowledge and instead opted for a lore-reference to make do with the current name situation

1) for cinematic effect. But also because after Sauron manipulated the Númenóreans and the island sunk he could only escape with his spirit which was then bound to the ring. So through the loss of the ring his spirit was unraveled more or less. 

2) it’s biology afaik

3) because it’s scary (cinema). 
Edit: the books describe it as screechy so it fits. 

4) iirc the nazgul are ‘afraid’ of water yes. But this could be purely from the movie. But I’m fairly sure it’s also in the books.

5) this I’m sure is for cinema only. It makes it easier to visualise that one has defeated the other. If I’m not mistaken this duel is not in the books. 

6) cinematic effect I think. It shows the evilness of the blade. 
Edit: it happens in the book too and its because the blades are bound to the shadow form of the nazgul who are not part of this world hence the blade isnt either. 

7) as explained elsewhere she is much lighter. Also she could be more skilled

8) afraid yes. Hence the reluctant crossing. Compared to the other scene this stream is also not so deep. 

9) this is a long story but part of it is that the Noldorian Elves are doomed by the deeds of their ancestor, Feanor. But it could also be part of Eru’s masterplan (the supreme being that creates this world)
Edit: this plan entails that the elves who are immortal and resistant to change would teach men and then fade from the world. 

10) not sure. Would make sense, but not sure. 
Edit: the orcs are crafted from elves tortured in Melkor’s fortress utumno hence they cannot stand the light anymore. They are totally corrupted. 

11) because he is now the ringbearer, or at least has been since leaving hobbiton. He is getting bound to the ring. 

12) if I’m not mistaken it would be the language of the Maiar/Valar. But I’m not sure. 
Edit: its quenya an older form of elvish.

Defend the truth. Even if it will get you killed. Do you know the struggles of Tolkien and the Nazis? This is a prime example. He didn't care that his book was not sold in Germany. It was the truth that mattered.

Albert Einstein was very vocal in the past about the catholic faith. His words will illustrate better than I ever could what this whole principle I was arguing about meant:

""Only the Church stood squarely across the path of Hitler's campaign for suppressing truth. I never had any special interest in the Church before, but now I feel a great affection and admiration because the Church alone has had the courage and persistence to stand for intellectual truth and moral freedom.

&#x200B;

>my complaint is with Peter Jackson, New Line Cinema and the major media outlets all making the claim that Peter Jackson is a genius and a true Tolkien purist who is working his hardest at bringing the definative telling of this story, and succeeding in creating Tolkien's intent and vision of the tale for the big screen. The ploy is quite obviously designed to convince the general public that this is going to be a direct screen adaptation of the original story and characters, and that Peter Jackson is some sort of mesianic wunderkind who read every chapter straight out of the book along with the cast before shooting the corresponding scene, then create a diatribe about how some Tolkien Scholar was wowed by the sets, and how the crew is painstakingly creating Swords and Props that have Elvish inscribed on them that actually MEANS something, yet not word one to address things like Peter Jackson INVENTING dialog, changing characters for no good reason and all the time bragging that he is being true to the Author's Characters and Story...

>From the many quotes I've seen from PJ and actors, they have a pretty warped idea of ""lover of the books"" and ""staying true to the story"". What a load of two-sided, speaking out of both sides of the mouth, drivel!

Also keep in mind that PJ had 3 books to work with while the RoP show seems to only have the Appendices and whatever references to the Second Age that appeared in the LoTR/Hobbit books. They might be able to use The Silmarillion and other things for a general guidance, but I'm not sure to what extent they can use them directly since they don't really have the rights. So, like it or not, the show's gonna be a very different type of adaptation. If that's an absolute deal breaker for you, it's fine. But for everyone else, it's better to adjust expectation and try not to compare everything to the trilogy since they aren't meant to be the same kind of thing from the very beginning.

But let's be honest, the only stories in Tolkien's work that can be readily adapted into movies/shows without too much change or filling in the blanks are LoTR and (to a lesser extent) The Hobbit. Everything else is basically like chronicles or encyclopedia entries or just short mythology tales without much detail. If people don't want Tolkien adaptations to fill in blanks, then the only type of adaptations they'll be ever able to appreciate are those of LoTR and Hobbit. It's fine if that's what they want, but I for one would love to see more of Tolkien's world be translated onto the screen, even if it means things have to be changed or added.","the funny thing is this is exactly the kind of interviews some purist fans hated the most because they believed that pj and the hollywood marketing caign were lying and manipulating the public into thinking that the movies were faithful to the books when they werent at least in their minds just a few exles from the  threadim not so much angry at the changes as i am in the way that peter jackson is speaking out of both sides of his mouth he claims that he is being true to the characters as jrr wrote them and that he is a huge fan and wouldnt make radical alteration to the mass media and then attempting to smooth the feathers of the real fan base by explaining and making statements that never get the attention of the mass media its as though there are two of him

And your way of thinking 100% has a place in society but it's for people who are already past that stage of blind consumerism.

I was aware of the corporate bullshit and the scapegoating which is why I am miserable 24/7 dispite highly benefiting from capital systems because I know how stacked against other people it is. So now that I understand your perspective. Yea, I agree but I can tell from someone who made WILD swings politically. Rhetoric matters and the compliment sandwich shit works wonders. Praise small good deeds while making a case for bigger change at the same time. For example instead of seeing a company make their icon rainbow and saying g HA virtue signaling losers which comes off like your mad about the rainbow and instead say somthing like ""If you're really for equality then why did you lobby this bigot Republican or why do you have work culture that makes minorities uncomfortable or unsafe.","we in  agreement on this comment other than youre stating a truthful problem with no solution and thats because there really isnt one unfortunately the vast majority of people just want to live their life as well and happy as they can and most are not marginalized those people have very right to live their short existance on earth being ignorant god do i wish so much i could do that but you have to understand in no reality are you going to make those people suddenly see radical change from what is normal so stupid virtue signaling and social pressure like capitalist pigs making the profile rainbow colored while donating to republicans has a socially beneficial small movement in the right direction and your way of thinking  has a place in society but its for people who are already past that stage of blind consumerism its more for people like me  years ago where i already moved from far  right to center left i was aware of the corporate bullshit and the scapegoating which is why i am miserable  dispite highly benefiting from capital systems because i know how stacked against other people it is so now that i understand your perspective yea i agree but i can tell from someone who made wild swings politically rhetoric matters and the compliment sandwich shit works wonders praise small good deeds while making a case for bigger change at the same time for exle instead of seeing a company make their icon rainbow and saying g ha virtue signaling losers which comes off like your mad about the rainbow and instead say somthing like if youre really for equality then why did you lobby this bigot republican or why do you have work culture that makes minorities uncomfortable or unsafe"

"437",32769,5,"/r/lotr",1,"This video which claims to put to bed myths around Tolkien provides no sources and presents itself as an authority but ends up spreading and creating more myths than it set out to quell. Here is the definitive answer on whether or not Elves have pointed ears or not:

Tolkien doesn’t often dwell on describing the minute physical details of his characters, so it is possible to read The Lord of the Rings and his other writings without noticing that either Elves or Hobbits have pointed ears. However, in a 1938 letter (No. 27, p. 35) to his American publishers Tolkien says Hobbits have “a round, jovial face; \[with\] ears only slightly pointed and ‘elvish.’”

From this it is clear that Elvish ears were more obviously pointed. This was confirmed when The Lost Road was published in 1987. In the Etymologies under the first definition of ‘LAS’, which is the element in lasse meaning ‘leaf’, there is this note: “The Quendian ears were more pointed and leaf-shaped than \[?human\]” (p.368). \[page references: The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, 1981 & 2006; The Lost Road, 2002 UK paperback\]

The actual quote from letter #27, to Houghton Mifflin, describing Hobbits: I picture a fairly human figure, not a kind of 'fairy' rabbit as some of my British reviewers seem to fancy: fattish in the stomach, shortish in the leg. A round, jovial face; ears only slightly pointed and 'elvish'; hair short and curling (brown). - The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien, #27

So Elves DO IN FACT HAVE POINTED EARS. There is no question about this.On the point of Dwarven woman having beards here is the canonical evidence and sources:

In the post-LotR Quenta Silmarillion is a section containing ""the words of Pengolod concerning the Naugrim"" (pp. 203+ of The War of the Jewels, US Edition at least). In paragraph 5, we learn that ""no Man nor Elf has ever seen a beardless Dwarf–unless he were shaven in mockery, and would then be more like to die of shame than of many other hurts that to us would seem more deadly. For the Naugrim have beards from the beginning of their lives, male and female alike; nor indeed can their womenkind be discerned by those of other race, be it in feature or in gait or in voice, nor in any wise save this: that they go not to war, and seldom save at direst need issue from their deep bowers and halls.""

In addition to this: Appendix A, where it is said of Dwarf women that They are in voice and appearance, and in garb if they must go on a journey, so like to the dwarf-men that the eyes and ears of other peoples cannot tell them apart. It seems that (male) Dwarves in Middle-earth all have beards: among other evidence, as Bilbo sets out on his adventure in The Hobbit, we read that ""His only comfort was that he couldn't be mistaken for a dwarf, as he had no beard."" Given that, the quote above must imply that Dwarf women were bearded as well.

So again, DWARF WOMAN HAVE BEARDS! This video is not well researched at all! No sources and literally contradicting what is written canonically. You are creating myths, not dispelling them!","this video which claims to put to bed myths around tolkien provides no sources and presents itself as an authority but ends up spreading and creating more myths than it set out to quell here is the definitive answer on whether or not elves have pointed ears or not

"443",40680,5,"/r/lotr",1,"A big part of it for me was watering down the slavic roots of the books and American-washing it (for lack of a better term). Think of all the intricate folklore, history, and mythology and the like you see in the games - there's lots of that in the books forming the foundation of the story. There's a lot of depth that is lost in translation between the books and the series, many characters that are shallower reflections of their counterparts as written, plots that are mangled in order to fit different narratives that are strewn throughout so that the writers could 'add' something of their own, etc.

I'll give you perhaps the best example of that which I can think of; at the end of the first season Ciri runs into Geralt essentially at random and embraces someone she actually doesn't know and has never met and then bizarrely says ""who's Yennefer?"". This is represented as a significant event but you as the viewer just kind of shrug as it just seems like a step in the plot rather than the culmination. 

In the books they encounter each other in Brokilon forest and the entire depth of their relationship is established there - long story short there's a lot of good content in that part of the story and Brokilon forest in general is a lot more interesting than what they displayed in the show. Instead in the series this is swapped out so that she can run around with some random elf that doesn't exist in the books for a few episodes (and largely didn't add anything of substance) and then eventually she stumbles her way into Geralt by happenstance. This happens in the books as well, but due to prior relationship it's a significant reunion and a climax of that plotline that ties their separate storylines together finally - the entire culmination of numerous different events. 

They essentially completely gutted the significance of the end of that storyline of the book the first season adapts all for seemingly no reason other than to add in their own character creation to existing source material which was already notably better than what they decided to go with.","a big part of it for me was watering down the slavic roots of the books and americanwashing it for lack of a better term think of all the intricate folklore history and mythology and the like you see in the games  theres lots of that in the books forming the foundation of the story theres a lot of depth that is lost in translation between the books and the series many characters that are shallower reflections of their counterparts as written plots that are mangled in order to fit different narratives that are strewn throughout so that the writers could add something of their own etc

1. If you believe that a lack of textual evidence for non-diversity among elves and dwarves means that casting diverse actors to play them *isn't* a diversion from what Tolkien would've envisioned for those races, you're deluding yourself.

And

2. If you believe that a black dwarf princess and a black elf are going to be the primary reasons this show fails, you're deluding yourself.

It is a fact that Tolkien would have definitely considered almost every one of his major races to be white European types. No amount of arguing that Sam was ""brown"" and some hobbits were ""darker"" is going to change that fact. Adding diversity to the cast is, and always would have been, a structural change to the lore.

However, this show is not going to fail (if it fails) because of a black character. Nor will such a character ""destroy"" Tolkien's story in any way. If this show fails, it will be because it is a poorly-told story in some way. Either the plot won't make sense, the characters will be shallow, the themes will incorporate ham-fisted modern politics in an awkward way, or the writing simply won't reflect Tolkien's themes or voice. Centralizing critiques of the show on the skin color of the actors is a waste of time and a complete diversion from things that actually matter about the show. It's missing the forest for the trees, and it's also an easy path towards being dismissed outright, even if you have nuanced thoughts. If the show is well-made, no amount of diverse characters will matter, because it will be *good*. Similarly, if it's bad, it won't be because of those actors, but rather the story they are a part of.

2. Nynaeve clearly transfers Egwene’s connection to the circle to herself in order to save Egwene, which doesn’t really follow the canonical rules of circles in the books but circles in the show seems to work slightly differently anyway (which ymmv on). Nynaeve doesn’t burn out. She’s just severely hurt (not dead). This has been confirmed in BTS material as well as by Rafe. He also agreed that they should have made that clearer in hindsight. 

3. The prevailing theory is that she’s not stilled, but that Ishamael put a tied off shield on her (which is a thing in the books). Why did they do it? Because Moiraine and Lan barely shows up in TGH and they need to give Rosamund Pike and Daniel Henney something to do in season 2. 

4. Not that strange. Plenty of members of the Kin could lead a circle if they needed to. Androl is really weak but can form circles. Circles doesn’t depend on strength, only a basic level of skill.

I’m not saying the finale was perfect. I thought it was the weakest episode of the season. But a lot of the complaints people have are based on weird reads of what happens in the episode or odd misrepresentations of book canon. 

To me, the biggest problems of the finale was the lack of an actual battle (the channeling of the circle looked good, but it was dramatically a bit inert), the complete sidelining of Lan (my guess is that he would have fought his way through trollocs to get to Moiraine if they could have had the practical trollocs), and the Perrin scenes.

"528",30933,5,"/r/lotr",1,"1. Sauron is in laymen's terms, an angel (Maiar). He bound his spirit or ""essence"" if you will to the ring. His physical form can die but his sprit lingers in Middle Earth as the ring is a kind of ""Anchor"" to  the world if you will so long as the ring exists so does Sauron. The big boom and shockwave was cinematic license by the films (plus it just looks cool haha) 

2. Simply just biology.

3. In the books the Nazgul have an ability called ""The Black Breath"" that instilled fear in all living things. I think the screeching is simply a cinematic change to that screeching sound to  show the demoralising effect of their presence. They can speak and their voices are screechy.

4. IIRC the wraiths arent scared of water but their mounts are. 

5. The Istari (Order of Wizards) are Angels sent to Middle Earth by the Valar (Archangels if you will) to inspire and aid the Free Peoples of Middle Earth to defeat Sauron. They took the visages of wizened old men to appear more knowledgeable and trustworthy. They are NOT there to directly challenge Sauron with their power, and are forbidden to use their full strength while on Middle Earth. The only time we see Gandalf use his full power is when he fought the Balrog, who is also a Maiar, albeit a corrupted version. Their staffs do act as conduits for their power and without them they cant use their power while in Middle Earth. 

6. Because magic. Basically by poisoning Frodo it was turning him into a wraith under the Witch Kings power. Plus it looks cool.

7.Elves are basically weightless. Legolas walks on top of snow while everyone else has to wade theough. So yes she is less of a burden to her horse and Frido doesn't weigh much so she will be quicker.

8. The wraiths may feer the river Anduin as it is the realm of Elrond Halfelven, a powerful elf and weilder of one of the Elven rings of power (Vilya, ring of air and the mightiest of the Elven Rings) which were forged by Celebrimbor an Elven smith not by Sauron.

9. Elves are immortal but can die of wounds, poison and ailment and ironically, depression. Can get so depressed they die. Elves are the firstborn race and their role was always to be a guide to the other races on how to take care of middle earth. It was always their role to leave once the other races gained a foothold. I think.

10. Regular orcs can move in sublight but it greatly weakens and hurts them.

11. By putting on the ring Frodo has claimed it and thus his fate is tied to the ring.  The ring drains its wearers strength and vitality over time. Again another creative licence by Peter Jackson to show this I believe.

12. Quenya. High elf gobbildy gook that does magical things haha. Magic elf language. Has great power.

The Witcher on Netflix chose to use a racially diverse cast and in the show it’s not addressed in any way. Netflix went with the approach that skin color did not matter to them for the shows casting. to me it looks kind of goofy and hinders the world building as a show could use different ethnic groups to differentiate between places. Too little is known about how this show will handle things. Will they go with the Witcher approach where an actor may be black but the character not necessarily from Harad, or will a black character living and traveling wherever has a background that come from harad. There is a difference between the two. Or if we see brown or Asian looking actors I hope the show uses them as Easternlings rather just mixing them in. So to summarize I hope they do NOT go the way of the Witcher, but rather use black and brown character to build out the world. With that said if the show has large numbers of Easternlings and people from harad living through the whole of middle earth that would looks strange to me because I don’t recall tolkin describing anything like that.

"557",38146,5,"/r/lotr",1,"For anyone who doesn't know, this isn't a fan theory - it's a direct quote from Tolkien, published in the *Myths Transformed* section of *The History of Middle Earth Volume X: Morogoth's Ring*. To give a little more context:

> Melkor 'incarnated' himself (as Morgoth) permanently. He did this so as to control the hroa,(2) the 'flesh' or physical matter, of Arda. He attempted to identify himself with it. A vaster, and more perilous, procedure, though of similar sort to the operations of Sauron with the Rings. Thus, outside the Blessed Realm, all 'matter' was likely to have a 'Melkor ingredient',(3) and those who had bodies, nourished by the hroa of Arda, had as it were a tendency, small or great, towards Melkor: they were none of them wholly free of him in their incarnate form, and their bodies had an effect upon their spirits.  
> But in this way Morgoth lost (or exchanged, or transmuted) the greater part of his original 'angelic' powers, of mind and spirit, while gaining a terrible grip upon the physical world. For this reason he had to be fought, mainly by physical force, and enormous material ruin was a probable consequence of any direct combat with him, victorious or otherwise. This is the chief explanation of the constant reluctance of the Valar to come into open battle against Morgoth. Manwe's task and problem was much more difficult than Gandalf's. **Sauron's, relatively smaller, power was concentrated; Morgoth's vast power was disseminated. The whole of 'Middle-earth' was Morgoth's Ring**, though temporarily his attention was mainly upon the North-west. Unless swiftly successful, War against him might well end in reducing all Middle-earth to chaos, possibly even all Arda.  
> It is easy to say: 'It was the task and function of the Elder King to govern Arda and make it possible for the Children of Eru to live in it unmolested.' But the dilemma of the Valar was this: Arda could only be liberated by a physical battle; but a probable result of such a battle was the irretrievable ruin of Arda. Moreover, the final eradication of Sauron (as a power directing evil) was achievable by the destruction of the Ring. No such eradication of Morgoth was possible, since this required the complete disintegration of the 'matter' of Arda. Sauron's power was not (for example) in gold as such, but in a particular form or shape made of a particular portion of total gold. Morgoth's power was disseminated throughout Gold, if nowhere absolute (for he did not create Gold) it was nowhere absent. (It was this Morgoth-element in matter, indeed, which was a prerequisite for such 'magic' and other evils as Sauron practised with it and upon it.) It is quite possible, of course, that certain 'elements' or conditions of matter had attracted Morgoth's special attention (mainly, unless in the remote past, for reasons of his own plans).

The short version is that all physical beings and matter within Middle Earth are tainted and corrupted to some extend by Morgoth, and thus that the only way to ever fully defeat him would be the complete destruction of the world. As we are told in the end of *The Silmarillion*:

> Yet the lies that Melkor, the mighty and accursed, Morgoth Bauglir, the Power of Terror and of Hate, sowed in the hearts of Elves and Men are a seed that does not die and cannot be destroyed; and ever and anon it sprouts anew, and will bear dark fruit even unto the latest days.","for anyone who doesnt know this isnt a fan theory  its a direct quote from tolkien published in the myths transformed section of the history of middle earth volume x morogoths ring to give a little more context

"589",21373,5,"/r/StarWars",0,"While there is little evidence, there is not none.

They just handled it like game of thrones handled their ending (ie. very badly).

1. Palpatine’s master learnt how to manipulate midiclorians to create life and to save others from dying, but not himself.
2. He taught Palpatine to do the same, but couldn’t figure out saving himself from dying, thus was killed.
3. Palpatine clearly sees this as a weakness, despite midiclorian manipulation to syphon the force out of Padme and into his implied midiclorian conceived son, Anakin, to save his life (Rey’s mother/father was probably Sheev’s first attempt at producing an “offspring” which could serve as a powerful, trainable, highly force-sensitive apprentice, while Anakin was his second).
4. One of the first things we find out Palpatine has done is create clones for a clone army.
5. An excellent demonstration and testing phase for the creation of an identical copy of oneself.
6. Do you really think Palpatine would order the new empire to destroy the cloning facilities on Kamino without keeping the proven successful technologies to himself to experiment on a method of sending his force spirit into an empty clone as a method of saving himself from dying? The one thing his master could not do?

The simple problem was that they didn’t have Snoke die on Starkiller Base when it blew up, and again in the Supremacy, and then again in the Death Star wreckage, setting up the idea of resurrection-by-cloning. Each iteration could be more and more humanlike/palpatinelike.

Much like Game of Thrones’ lack of setup for its ending >!(ie. Daenerys needed more time to turn evil)!<, a payoff is nothing without setup, for instance, Rey should have become a Sith from killing Palpatine in anger (as he’s always claimed he wants) and fought Ren as one final lightsaber battle (among other things that should have been different), it was set up that way with Rey having been drawn to the dark side and Ren vice versa. The trilogy could end with them agreeing to disagree and finally bringing a true balance of light and dark to the galaxy.

Glad they at least expanded on the idea of cloning force sensitives in The Mandalorian, but it definitely should have been done far more actively in the sequels.

It was all there written for them, but corporate probably screwed the writers plans over and forced the “safe” blockbuster options instead of continuing Star Wars’ trend of pioneering the future of cinema.","while there is little evidence there is not none

Not every marvel movie is great, but feige clearly is intelligent enough to understand when fan service is a slam dunk and when it's just going to get in the way.

 I can think of so many examples of it. In shang-chi you get to see references to Extremis from Iron Man 3, a black widow that was in the 2021 movie, Abomination, and Wong, but they appear at the beginning of the second act and don't detract from the plot. They serve to show how Shang-Chi is being introduced to a mystical and super powered world. Then Wong doesn't show up again until at the very end of the movie when the story is concluded. Civil War is both an Avengers movie and a Captain America movie, and smartly ties Tony to the story by connecting Bucky to his parent's death, which was established way back in the first MCU movie, giving us the fight between Cap and Tony without making the entire scenario feel contrived. 

For some reason it just feels like Star Wars doesn't have the proper leadership to make this happen. I wonder if jumping around the timeline so much is part of it?

no one knew who he was or showed him any respect for his rule fair enough this is explored a bit in the first few episodes but he deals with it like a loveable little bounty hunter with a heart of gold  rather than the ruthless cold killer with a loose set of moral values as he has been seen as since the s  pykes were a bigger crime syndicate posing a threat in the last  episodes before that they didnt pose any threat and were hardly built up at all until then defended the city defeated the pykes in the very last episode the show was structured very poorly up until then and even then everything came to a head way to quickly for a tv show  people respect him this is literally only talked about and never shown until the very last scene the only locals he interacts with are the s cyberpunk ones he hires to be some foot soldiers who he lets boss him around and disrespect him a bunch overall the pacing and structure of the show is all over the place and they completely changed a fan favourite character whos on screen revival was almost  years in the making"

because the characters and peoples they portray and act as are w h i t e. do white people disgust you so much that you just cant accept that not only are there homogeneously black and asian countries and peoples but also white ones and that just as there are stories about black and asian ones, there are also stories about white ones (like Tolkiens Mythology)? Like i said, if they hired the black actors to play Haradrim or people from Rhun it would be perfectly fine, in fact it would make zero sense to not cast them, but they didnt do that did they. so yes, they were hired just for diversitys sake.


> Ah, the old Zulu warrior argument. Almost as popular as asking about a race swapped black panther. Did the Zulu nation exist? Are you adapting it for historical accuracy? Are there other reasons for the swap? Your not going to find me angry with the Anne Boleyn show either, except it’s writing is abysmal but all the actors do as best as they can with it.

this whole paragraph is a really funny attempt to undermine the fact that you wouldnt accept white zulus or a white black panther, but will gladly welcome the blackwashing of european mythology, disingenous and vile.","why did they cast white actors

The game I worked on the longest had constant licensing issues that made them have to drop weeks or months of work because rights could not be secured or the controlling company did not like the work or representation of their IP. That doesn't mean work stopped until things were approved.  Work continued until something got a hard ""no"". So I'm familiar with game design and licensing issues.  But what you're referring to is all about License Rights, the specific deal that was made with Disney, which you don't have any clue what that deal includes, and not game design.  The name used for a card does not change the games design or how it plays so changing Slave 1 to ""Boba Fett's Firespray"" affects nothing in the game.

In this specific case, if Disney had already been making the move away from Slave 1 before the Jango Fett's Slave 1 expansion was released in November 2020 then they would not have approved it. Regardless, no matter what their deal is with AMG, Disney could have made a request to move away from the Slave 1 name and AMG could have included it in their PRINT AND PLAY cards which costs AMG absolutely nothing and keeps them on good terms with Disney regardless of any legal requirement.

tolkien had the habit of mentioning whether a particular character had some physical attributes diverging from a regular white person like all the occasions of him telling us whether someone has slanted eyes"

* Can't believe they literally blueballed Boba's jetpack rocket. Giant droidekas are fuckin lit, but also why not just stand behind them and leisurely walk in the other direction as it turns around? 

* I feel like every other line Boba has was taken almost verbatim from 2005 Battlefront 2, they're hitting me right in the nostalgia. ""Save it for the pikes!"" ""We need reinforcements!"" ""Aaagh!""

* I've been playing a lot of xcom recently and I keep yelling at characters to get the high ground, stand behind cover, and stop grouping up. Very disappointed in the small unit tactics of these untrained civilians and non military bounty hunters. 

* Did mod girl always have a british accent? Could've sworn it was american in her first appearance.

* Did R2 really just drop off the kid with the first human he found? I get that he'd be callous after seeing all those jedi children die in the past, but man.

* Mando's dad reflex catch

* Cad Bane really just spritzed the rancor with some fire like a disobedient cat and it worked

* ""I knew you were a killer"" like yeah dude he just shot like fifty people a minute ago, he had his pet rancor eat one. You haven't proved a point just because you made him kill a named character and he literally never had any moral compunction against killing in the first place

"781",42593,5,"/r/lotr",1,"I guess the impasse is that there is both this vocalized desire to consume non Caucasian dominated (blockbuster) fiction and at the same time there is zero being made. So it’s not really an equal sided argument from the perspective of a non-white actor trying to work to get big gigs. For example, if you have concerns about your history (“your” is doing a lot work here), may I point out that this is actually much more acute of the problem facing non white cultures? So what is worse, a different characterization in Vikings or LOTR or the relative non existence of alternate cultural epics with different racial homogeneity? I would say the latter is what we have and that changes glacially slow, and the former can help foment that. Given that all fiction morphs over time, I find this racial inclusion not only acceptable, but a tradition as old as time (white Jesus, anyone?)

Also friendly suggestion to check out Last Kingdom on Netflix if you haven’t already and If you’re into historical fiction of Vikings. Bad ass stuff. 

But the lack of opportunities in new IPs is what I mean when I say casting diversity should be the expectation for what *does* get made. The alternative is upholding the status quo. It’s *stupid* and *ridiculous* (IMO) to uphold the whiteness of make believe *elves* over the real people who should be given an equal opportunity to portray them. If you are saying it’s tokenizing and not far enough, im inclined to agree. They should have invented a new continent and said “these elves are cousins and made of the same secret fire of Ilúvatar but of different earth.” But I don’t know they haven’t done just that… neither does anyone else. Which is the point I’m making. 

I respect your opinion overall because you say these kind of counter projects ought to be being made for consumption and I think you come from the right place, and I will admit that we have some awesome, AWESOME shows today that have a refreshingly different casting, and the rise of Korean Netflix dramas offers some notable entries in the fantasy genre. Also, watchmen on HBO is…probably the best thesis statement on how blackness, for example, is an inherently germane theme in the original source material (which the author loved iirc).","i guess the impasse is that there is both this vocalized desire to consume non caucasian dominated blockbuster fiction and at the same time there is zero being made so its not really an equal sided argument from the perspective of a nonwhite actor trying to work to get big gigs for exle if you have concerns about your history your is doing a lot work here may i point out that this is actually much more acute of the problem facing non white cultures so what is worse a different characterization in vikings or lotr or the relative non existence of alternate cultural epics with different racial homogeneity i would say the latter is what we have and that changes glacially slow and the former can help foment that given that all fiction morphs over time i find this racial inclusion not only acceptable but a tradition as old as time white jesus anyone

I think the mentality was much more about wanting to capitalize on the license as quickly as possible, getting a new Star Wars main series film in theaters as soon as possible, and as much of a guarantee of being ""good"" as possible too.

It would take time to plan out a full trilogy, after all, and then you'd have to find a good creative team that's willing to stand by the franchise for all three films. And meanwhile, you'd have investors wondering why it's taking 4-5 years to put out a movie that everyone knows will be gangbusters profitable, even Phantom Menace made a billion dollars, and that was widely reviled at the time!

So, they went with a more conservative approach. Just make one movie for now, and bring in JJ Abrams to direct, a man that... while not a good writer or really having a good grasp on storytelling in general (his mystery boxes doomed the sequels), he knows how to turn a good script into an exciting, energetic movie with fully engaged actors and exceptional technical execution.

He's especially good when there's a fairly blank slate that he can work with, where he's not having to deal with pesky continuity issues.

While I agree that Disney should have planned out the full trilogy itself, I get why they didn't.

hes especially good when theres a fairly blank slate that he can work with where hes not having to deal with pesky continuity issues

while i agree that disney should have planned out the full trilogy itself i get why they didnt but while i do love the last jedi it definitely was a mistake for disney to not go okay now that weve shown that we can make a star wars movie thats good lets plan out episodes  and  and shoot them back to back"

I utterly adore TLJ. 

At least those movies are *about* something. TFA is a fun, albeit safe, risk averse throwback to a New Hope that has to reintroduce a general audience to Star Wars, while also bringing in new characters we are expected to root for in a new trilogy. It mostly works. JJ Abrams can make exactly one type of movie, and he did this one well. It’s exactly what he’s good at. 

TLJ is a beautifully shot and directed character study of a film, that really works to examine what Star Wars has to say and what The Jedi really stand for and are all about, and asks some pointed and ambitious questions about the franchise and the characters as a whole. It sets the stage for a potentially incredibly interesting finale, that could have really pushed Star Wars as a movie franchise forward in new exciting ways. 

RoS is a polished turd. 

It is a movie built purely out of studio cowardice, executive meddling, and zero foresight or planning. It only even has spare moments that work at all because of the inherent strength of performance of the cast. It’s just incredible how bad it is, but more so because of WHY it’s so bad. It reads like JJ Abrams got asked to write a sequel to TFA over a weekend at gun point and is the product of a coke fueled binge where he just watched a Star Wars Explained video about what happened in the last 6 or 7 Star Wars movies up until this point because he forgot. 

They didn’t need to plan the entire thing in advance. Obviously that would have helped, but Disney just needed to stick to their guns, and keep the narrative ideas consistent and have some central vision for the whole thing. They couldn’t even do that.","i like tfa

"846",38768,5,"/r/lotr",1,"Tolkien does explore this, the diference is in the context of the story.

In ASOIAF, wars occur between realms of men, for resources and profit, who all have political systems in place which work similar to one another (some form of chaste system that taxes the merchant class). So its pretty much a political/economic system like the one that existed on earth during the middle-ages and antiquity.

In Tolkien's legendarium this is very different: For example, what type of economic system do Orcs in Mordor have? How does Sauron produce food to feed his armies? Do Orcs get paid? What type of economic system do elves have? is it the same system for those in Lorien than those in Mirkwood? Do dwarves have taxes or dwarvish realms just fund themselves through mining precious metals? Do Hobbits have a central government or just local governments?

The issue is that Tolkien's world is vastly different from ours, while ASOIAF is exactly like ours was in the past. Also the many races of middle-earth kind of make this hard to dig in. We don't even know if Gondor had taxation.

The reason tolkien never explains this is because it would be absurd to assume that middle-earth functions like this.

Tolkien explores bad politics, but in the form of incompetence of the rulers (Lake-Town is a good example). Do remember Middle-earth is in a constant state of war between free realms, unlike Westeros who is pretty much a unified nation under the Targaryan dinasty, so bad politics leads to a realm's destruction.

Finally, his abandoned sequel (the new shadow) of LOTR was going to be more political in nature. Maybe there are even manuscripts on tolkien's behalf which explain some of these things.","tolkien does explore this the diference is in the context of the story

the issue is that tolkiens world is vastly different from ours while asoiaf is exactly like ours was in the past also the many races of middleearth kind of make this hard to dig in we dont even know if gondor had taxation

the reason tolkien never explains this is because it would be absurd to assume that middleearth functions like this

tolkien explores bad politics but in the form of incompetence of the rulers laketown is a good exle do remember middleearth is in a constant state of war between free realms unlike westeros who is pretty much a unified nation under the targaryan dinasty so bad politics leads to a realms destruction

finally his abandoned sequel the new shadow of lotr was going to be more political in nature maybe there are even manuscripts on tolkiens behalf which explain some of these things"

I've had doubts about this show, and Boba was MIA in the last 2 episodes.  But he more than made up for it here.  Yeah, we and seemingly even he don't know why he suddenly wants to be a crime (or more likely non-criminal) leader.  He still doesn't even seem to be very good at it.  But in the end despite all that, he won the day and ripped the drug dealing murdering Pykes to shreds.  I was probably the biggest critic of Obi-Wan's war crime fake surrender in the Clone Wars movie, but honestly I didn't mind it via the Twi'lek politician here because those murdering Pykes deserved it a thousand times over, especially after killing Garsa Fwip and Cobb Vanth (or is the latter dead...?

Even their short talk reveals nothing, only the quick reference of what we already knew with Cad referencing he knew Boba since Boba was a kid.  


And as for the word that Filoni and Favreau were undoing the mistakes of the sequel trilogy, this leads to my only real complaint.  Luke's cruel ultimatum to Grogu wasn't a bluff at all.  He really is a non-attachment hardliner, unlike his Legends counterpart.  Canon Luke learned nothing from his experiences in the OT on how attachment won the day.

But also it's just fantasy. The same could be asked of Kazad-Dum, Orthanc, Minas Tirith, Bag End, and especially Barad-Dur. 

Thoughts on this scene:

Love the birds for scale. Very nice touch.

IIRC they built an actual full scale model of the foot for that shot where the company rows passed in profile.

I love Viggo's performance betraying just a bit of awe and pride in his heritage. Its not too much, but just the right amount. But he feels it strongly enough that he just has to share it with Frodo. I believe this is the first time in the films where he shows actual pride in ancestory and Gondor and its definitely a transition for his character. This isn't so in the books, but it works well in the films. Every other mention of Gondor/Isildur/the throne has Aragorn coming off as forlorn, insecure, and full doubts. He does pick the shards of Narsil off the floor at Rivendell but its not the same since he immediately expresses doubts to Arwen. 

Boromir's giddy smile. Like, I dunno, an archeology enthusiast seeing the Pyramids of Gina for the first time. 


Love the detail of the quarries on the riverside cliffs showing where they excavated the rock for the statues.


Good shit all around. Jackson gets a ton of credit for this scene. This is pure excellent direction. A lesser director would have done some tacky shit like a circling helicopter (ahem* last shot of Force Awakens) shot of the statues and failed to get the character beats rights, brief and understated as they are, or worse, just fail to grasp the importance of this scene as a transition and skipped it to save budget and runtime. Also would have fucked up the music and made it more epic and triumphant to fit the majesty of the statues rather than epic and kind of vaguely ominous as Jackson and Shore wisely did.



All these excellent direction choices in 40 seconds of footage and yet just about every scene in the film is just high caliber and dense with correct choices and rich detail. 


Thats why these films stand out and stand the test of time and even people who lack the filmmaking vocabulary to explain *why* they are so excellent still say there is a je nes said quoi about these films that just sets them apart even from other great films. 


The only real flaws IMO is slightly overusing Gimli for comic relief in films 2 and 3, some stupid Legolas action that takes me out of the film (shieldboarding and 1v1ing the Oliphant), Sam being sent away before Shelobs tunnel rather than just getting lost and separated, and there should have been at least a brief 30 second scene where Merry and Pippin commit to going on the quest, since the film has them run into Frodo and Sam on accident. Frodo does tell them he's going to Bree but there's never really a scene where they understand that Frodo is leaving probably forever and will be in extreme mortal danger probably forever, but resolve to go with him anyway. They just sorta bump into each other and then are along for the ride. 

Also, I'd change up the Army of the Dead entirely. Just have a shot Dol Amroth besieged by land and by the corsair fleet at sea once Aragorn and co. come out of the paths of the dead. Aragorn draws Anduril and points at the besieged city/fortress and says ""fulfil your oath"". Brief shot of a translucent gray mass of ghost army headed towards the seige. Done. This adds virtually no time at all and allows Aragorn to arrive at Minas Tirith with actual Gondorian men with him, so we can avoid the stupid imagery of that green wave riding over the entire battlefield and city, which feels sorta cheap and dues ex machina. Actual men as reinforcements would feel way more satisfying but we still make use of the Army of the Dead and maintain the surprise of the corsair fleet being under Aragorns command, rather than emeny reinforcements. This is what happened in the book anyway and its perfectly filmable. This is one of the bigger structural flaws thats more than just a nitpick. 

Oh and nix that terrible ""evil Galadriel"" effect.

These are only for the theatrical cuts. The extended cuts have more flaws. (Aragorn would never ever behead an envoy come to parley, even if he came in bad faith just to taunt and demoralize them.... and the paths of the dead skull avalanche was stupid).

Small nitpicks, except the ghost army thing. Otherwise the trilogy is perfect.

also id change up the army of the dead entirely just have a shot dol amroth besieged by land and by the corsair fleet at sea once aragorn and co come out of the paths of the dead aragorn draws anduril and points at the besieged cityfortress and says fulfil your oath brief shot of a translucent gray mass of ghost army headed towards the seige done this adds virtually no time at all and allows aragorn to arrive at minas tirith with actual gondorian men with him so we can avoid the stupid imagery of that green wave riding over the entire battlefield and city which feels sorta cheap and dues ex machina actual men as reinforcements would feel way more satisfying but we still make use of the army of the dead and maintain the surprise of the corsair fleet being under aragorns command rather than emeny reinforcements this is what happened in the book anyway and its perfectly filmable this is one of the bigger structural flaws thats more than just a nitpick 

oh and nix that terrible evil galadriel effect

these are only for the theatrical cuts the extended cuts have more flaws aragorn would never ever behead an envoy come to parley even if he came in bad faith just to taunt and demoralize them and the paths of the dead skull avalanche was stupid

small nitpicks except the ghost army thing otherwise the trilogy is perfect

A couple days of repairs with the imperial fleet scouring the field. Then the worm is aroused and they make their escape. Another day of evasion before hiding on the side of a Star Destroyer.

Another day or two in detention. Another day to escape. That’s maybe three weeks at least right there. This way Luke gets actual time to train.

What of absorption of other book characters into the characters as presented on film in the trilogy? Arwen is book Arwen and book Glorfindel combined. Eomer is book Eomer and book Erkenbrand combined. What of Lurtz and Gothmog? What of all the trilogy changes like Faramir, Frodo in Osgiliath, the Warg attack in Rohan? Saruman dying at Orthanc?

""It feels like they think they can do better"". That is as subjective of an opinion as possible and, really, one of the biggest stretches that is likely furthest from the truth.

The region shown is *not* the Europe of Middle Earth. It is Numenor, the Atlantis of Middle Earth whose people *traveled far and wide and established trade and colonies as far as Umbar, Harad, and Beyond.* Eriador is, *possibly*, proto-Europe but that is not explicitly told nor does it make distinct geographical sense. Beleriand as it existed in the first age would have stretched all the way across the ocean to Canada and the Arctic, and of course at that time the world was flat and the sun passed over it and so anything you might like to surmise about real world skin tone implications compared to latitude don't really hold merit. Trees in Beleriand, if the sun worked the same way on flat Arda as on spherical Earth, would be no more than stumps. And that's just for considering *human* skin tone.

Elves, Dwarves, et all are *long gone* and are not the genetic ancestors of modern humans so likewise the skin tones of Elves and Dwarves are *irrelevant*. If modern European *humans* are ""white"" then it stands to reason that proto European *humans* should *probably* be white-ish but what has that got to do with extinct Elves and Dwarves?

Also black Dwarven skin in *any clan* makes sense. *Dwarves are made from Earth and Stone. Not all earth and stone is white. Dwarven skin color is not described by Tolkien*.

There isn't any good reason to think that diversity shouldn't exist in this setting except that it contradicts preconceived notions you might have that you are having trouble discarding.","pjs trilogy is lotr adapted to the screen and it is perfect not because it is merely lotr content but because of the love blood sweat tears etc

"1128",32233,5,"/r/lotr",1,"As someone whose favorite book of all time is The Hobbit and actually (unironically) enjoyed PJ's film trilogy, I personally wouldn't recommend skipping the book and just watching the movies as an alternative.

While one's personal opinion and enjoyment of The Hobbit trilogy is certainly up to the viewer, it cannot be denied that the films and the book are both very different entities. While both more or less share the same story, the book was a simple and easy-to-follow children's book, while the films were much larger in scale and focused more on being a spiritual prequel to the Lord of the Rings instead of being its own thing like the original novel did.

I'd also like to include that The Hobbit book is actually quite an easy read compared to other Tolkien works like LotR and especially The Silmarillion. It was written as a book for children and reads more like fairytale than an epic like its sequel, so you would certainly have quite an easy time reading this book and maybe even finish it in no time!

Of course, if you're not really a reader (which is perfectly alright), as someone here already suggested, you could try listening to an audiobook version of the story. There are many great ones to choose from (including one read by Gollum himself, Andy Serkis), but I'd personally recommend checking out Bluefax's reading as it feels like an audio drama complete with distinct voices for each character, sound effects, and even the utilization of Howard Shore's phenomenal score from the movies.

Though, if none of these work for you, then maybe if you'd be interested, you could check out the Rankin Bass animated film that was released back in 1977 for although it both cut/changed certain elements from the book, it does at least better match the tone of the book than PJ's trilogy did.

Of course, if none of these really work, then I guess you could watch the movies instead as an alternative.

These are just my personal suggestions of course and in the end, it's really up to your best judgement. I do at least hope that this could be of help in any way for your decision on how to experience The Hobbit, and I would also like to apologize for this rather lengthy response (I absolutely love all things The Hobbit, both book and adaptations, so I definitely want you to have the best possible experience when reading/listening/watching this magical story). Cheers!","as someone whose favorite book of all time is the hobbit and actually unironically enjoyed pjs film trilogy i personally wouldnt recommend skipping the book and just watching the movies as an alternative

while ones personal opinion and enjoyment of the hobbit trilogy is certainly up to the viewer it cannot be denied that the films and the book are both very different entities while both more or less share the same story the book was a simple and easytofollow childrens book while the films were much larger in scale and focused more on being a spiritual prequel to the lord of the rings instead of being its own thing like the original novel did

id also like to include that the hobbit book is actually quite an easy read compared to other tolkien works like lotr and especially the silmarillion it was written as a book for children and reads more like fairytale than an epic like its sequel so you would certainly have quite an easy time reading this book and maybe even finish it in no time

of course if youre not really a reader which is perfectly alright as someone here already suggested you could try listening to an audiobook version of the story there are many great ones to choose from including one read by gollum himself andy serkis but id personally recommend checking out bluefaxs reading as it feels like an audio drama complete with distinct voices for each character sound effects and even the utilization of howard shores phenomenal score from the movies

though if none of these work for you then maybe if youd be interested you could check out the rankin bass animated film that was released back in  for although it both cutchanged certain elements from the book it does at least better match the tone of the book than pjs trilogy did

of course if none of these really work then i guess you could watch the movies instead as an alternative

these are just my personal suggestions of course and in the end its really up to your best judgement i do at least hope that this could be of help in any way for your decision on how to experience the hobbit and i would also like to apologize for this rather lengthy response i absolutely love all things the hobbit both book and adaptations so i definitely want you to have the best possible experience when readinglisteningwatching this magical story cheers"

"1161",15033,5,"/r/StarWars",0,"9) And this shows a big problem with what the show tried to even convey.  
 What was the point of it at all? Nothing is really ever explained.   
Other than insinuated and we get bare bones knowledge. You are left to   
fill in gaps, and use Star Wars Lore as a whole. And they do a lot of   
""PG"" storytelling handwaving. Spice is never given a full description,   
other than insinuated that its a drug, and that drugs are bad mmmmkay,   
don't sell drugs near our schools bad guys. There is never a real face   
to the enemy in this show either. I guess its just the Pykes as a whole,  
 but their never really made to be terrorizing on a macro or micro   
level. Ok, they took out Fett's Tusken family, but he seemed to move on   
pretty easily from that. Ok their doing shady bad guy sounding stuff,   
but we're not really shown it. The most violence we get from them   
outright and shown to be them is in Episode 6, at the very last scene   
when they blow up the Sanctuary. Or maybe Cobb's getting shot by Cad   
Bane, but again thats Bane being made the face of it, and thats saved   
for the next to last scene of Episode 6.   
At the end of the day.... I give just a big yawn and feel like ""what was  
 the point"" of any of it. This little minor squabble doesn't even feel   
fully resolved because we know the Pykes are a multi-planet syndicate,   
and Fett is literally a group of less than 30 people on one planet. What  
 would stop the Pykes from going full genocide wipe-out mode upon   
return? Especially if they are as scary as they are hinted at? Whats to   
stop them from bringing in ships and just laying waste to Mos Eisley,   
Mos Espa, the Palace, Freetown, etc, and blasting them all to bits? They  
 don't care about the civilians, so whats to stop them from doing this?   
Especially now given what all Fett has done to them. I would find it   
extremely hard to believe they'd be ok with it all and just shrug and   
say, ""Well I guess Tatooine is Fett's, we'll move on, la da la da.""   
And frankly, after this season and show, I don't even care to return to   
Tatooine or Fett's character. Dinn and Grogu are far more interesting. I  
 have no interest in seeing Fett post-Book of Fett, and have no interest  
 in where his character goes from here. What do we get, stories of him   
palling around with Fennec and Cobb defending the mean streets of   
Tatooine? Ehh.","and this shows a big problem with what the show tried to even convey  
 what was the point of it at all nothing is really ever explained   
other than insinuated and we get bare bones knowledge you are left to   
fill in gaps and use star wars lore as a whole and they do a lot of   
pg storytelling handwaving spice is never given a full description   
other than insinuated that its a drug and that drugs are bad mmmmkay   
dont sell drugs near our schools bad guys there is never a real face   
to the enemy in this show either i guess its just the pykes as a whole  
 but their never really made to be terrorizing on a macro or micro   
level ok they took out fetts tusken family but he seemed to move on   
pretty easily from that ok their doing shady bad guy sounding stuff   
but were not really shown it the most violence we get from them   
outright and shown to be them is in episode  at the very last scene   
when they blow up the sanctuary or maybe cobbs getting shot by cad   
bane but again thats bane being made the face of it and thats saved   
for the next to last scene of episode    
at the end of the day i give just a big yawn and feel like what was  
 the point of any of it this little minor squabble doesnt even feel   
fully resolved because we know the pykes are a multiplanet syndicate   
and fett is literally a group of less than  people on one planet what  
 would stop the pykes from going full genocide wipeout mode upon   
return especially if they are as scary as they are hinted at whats to   
stop them from bringing in ships and just laying waste to mos eisley   
mos espa the palace freetown etc and blasting them all to bits they  
 dont care about the civilians so whats to stop them from doing this   
especially now given what all fett has done to them i would find it   
extremely hard to believe theyd be ok with it all and just shrug and   
say well i guess tatooine is fetts well move on la da la da

Or maybe not. Maybe Snoke started as a more ancient Sith Lord… however his speech about the rise and fall of the republic and empire still whispers Palpatine to me.

My favorite resolution would have been that the Vader persona was connecting to Kylo through the mask. Continuing the idea that Anakin was killed and locked away in Vader’s mind, the evil of Vader maybe lingered in a symbol deeply associated with him. Then Kylo could be saved by Anakin’s true spirit, a visit from him as a force ghost.

I want to point out what I feel is an important distinction here.

It's okay for film and television studios to want to make a profit on their products.

That's literally their business model: they create a product, and if the product is popular they get to sell tickets/ads/subscriptions.  

**That's not greed.  That's their job.**

And if they want to be good at their job, they have to minimize costs while maximizing revenues. 

And that's where studio executives are wildly different from actors, directors, and screenwriters: an executive is a *businessman*, not an artist.

Studios don't care about innovative ideas or compelling characters...at least, not beyond ""people seem to like these things, so I want to sell them some.""

Studios want a safe bet.  A sure thing.  A winning formula.  They want a new version of the latest popular thing.

*Game of Thrones* convinced studios that fantasy was a safe bet.

So now we're seeing a bunch of new fantasy being released.  And many or most of them are...formulaic.  

Nobody wants a series they love to be reduced to a generic formula.  A lot of *Witcher* fans are not happy with the Netflix series.  A lot of *Wheel of Time* fans are not happy with the Amazon series.  

Tolkien fans have good reason to be worried about the Amazon series.

"1253",13866,5,"/r/StarWars",0,"I think out of all the Disney+ MCU/Star Wars stuff that does the big, long fight scenes in its season finale, this one kinda dragged on and was shot terribly. I like some of Robert Rodriguez's work, like Machete and Planet Terror, but I think his film style isn't best suited for Star Wars.

It's also the worst show out of all these Disney+ geek stuff, since it attempted to juggle the Tusken and the Crime Lord plots, former had better development that helped shaped Boba Fett from badass legend to kid-friendly Bantha enthusiast who hates space drugs. Both plotlines could have been better paced. While we know Boba became a Crime Lord, it took a couple episodes for him to explain why he chose that new path. For the Crime Lord plot, they could have shown how the spice or the Syndicate's influence would have affected the local citizens.

You know something's funky if the Mando episodes are well loved more than the (old) fan-favorite Boba Fett. Even so, Mando visiting Luke's school/reuniting with Grogu should have been saved for their show since it removes most of Season 2's importance and weight. Imagine if in Mandalorian S2, after Boba Fett got reintroduced, there are now three episodes about his time with the Tuskens, with Mando's plot getting underdeveloped/rushing to the big fight.

Overall, I expected a bit more grittiness to a show about one of the best Star Wars characters who helped shaped the ""Mandalorian"" culture, but I guess the grittiness tone ended up being reserved for Mando in his return episode.

"1293",12173,5,"/r/StarWars",0,"So, overall, I found the series entertaining, but not terribly fulfilling. The individual character arcs were interesting, the dialogue was pretty decent, most of the acting was OK.

However, I don't think Temuera Morrison really did a lot more than look stoic and I still think it would have made more sense, agewise, to bring back Daniel Logan and age him up a little rather than pretending that time in a Sarlacc can not only make you older but also pudgier. I have no idea whether Logan can act or not, but this was not exactly challenging acting so I don't understand the choice, especially since sources say he was promised the opportunity to come back on 1313 before the Disney sale.

I had two big issues (three, actually, but one of them is addressed in a separate post). **One, the crimelord story just made no sense and it seemed to me the writers don't have a grasp on how organized crime actually works.** In no logical universe can someone just declare himself Godfather by moving into the Godfather's home and then expecting everyone to just bow down to him. You not only need significantly more muscle than Boba had (even at the end) to enforce ""protection,"" but you need to...do things. Organized crime is criminal, yes, but it still requires actual WORK from the employees and actual MANAGEMENT from the bosses. This was a story of someone who sat in a chair and then was aghast that no one recognized his authority. By the end, there is some more justification, but even then the ultimate resolution justified his being elected President of Tatooine, or over-Marshall. Not ""Daimyo."" He also chased away the main source of the drug trade, so it's unclear what ""crime"" he wants to be ""boss"" over.

**The second is that this series felt cheap** and lazy in a way that the Mandalorian didn't (or at least successfully obscured). The Twi'leks, for example, look terrible and I won't be convinced otherwise. Suddenly there is NO variation in the length of their headtails and they just look like inert, stiff foam blocks on top of actors' heads. The Gamorreans inexplicably can no longer afford outfits, and consequently they just look like bodypainted fat dudes wearing masks. The costume and vehicle design for the ""mods"" has been extensively discussed elsewhere.

The use of the ""Volume"" got less interesting and there are decisions that just seemed poorly researched. There is no sense of distance among the major cities on Tatooine; they stuck Mos Espa in a giant crater despite it never having been shown that way before. The radical change in Tusken sumptuary rules can't simply be explained by ""different tribes."" The live-action translation of the Pykes was much less interesting than how they were shown in the cartoons. No  headway has been made in improving the ""young Skywalker"" or other CGI effects. This just felt beholden to budget constraints in a way the previous series did not.","so overall i found the series entertaining but not terribly fulfilling the individual character arcs were interesting the dialogue was pretty decent most of the acting was ok

however i dont think temuera morrison really did a lot more than look stoic and i still think it would have made more sense agewise to bring back daniel logan and age him up a little rather than pretending that time in a sarlacc can not only make you older but also pudgier i have no idea whether logan can act or not but this was not exactly challenging acting so i dont understand the choice especially since sources say he was promised the opportunity to come back on  before the disney sale

i had two big issues three actually but one of them is addressed in a separate post one the crimelord story just made no sense and it seemed to me the writers dont have a grasp on how organized crime actually works in no logical universe can someone just declare himself godfather by moving into the godfathers home and then expecting everyone to just bow down to him you not only need significantly more muscle than boba had even at the end to enforce protection but you need todo things organized crime is criminal yes but it still requires actual work from the employees and actual management from the bosses this was a story of someone who sat in a chair and then was aghast that no one recognized his authority by the end there is some more justification but even then the ultimate resolution justified his being elected president of tatooine or overmarshall not daimyo he also chased away the main source of the drug trade so its unclear what crime he wants to be boss over

"1297",50617,5,"/r/lotr",1,"I agree on the importance of music. One of my favourite things about the show at the moment is that Howard Shore is scoring it. I'm excited to hear it and feel it, and didn't expect him to get involved to be honest. Music has always been one of the most important aspects of filmmaking to me personally.

You might already be aware, but trailers are a whole industry of its own, and in trailers the music is almost never composed and produced by the composer of the film itself. This teaser likely had custom ordered music, so it is made for purpose, but it's still very much in the trailer music industry world in style. Trailer music is like film music on steroids generally, and tends to rely on simplicity and immediate attention and effectiveness. It's both a proven working approach and a hindrance of course. There's a reason it's become so popular, but it's also a bit limiting in stylistic and artistic terms. 

What that does mean, however, is that the trailer music is not really representative of the music in the series. It's made by different people for marketing specifically. So a Shore score is sure to change the tone of the show quite a bit. 

Again, the music made for the teaser is amazingly well done and produced. I really don't want to sound like I think I did a better job here musically speaking, or that they did not do a great job. It's just a different approach to see how it feels, and this sort of an approach was most likely not even an option to the composer from the brief they got.","i agree on the importance of music one of my favourite things about the show at the moment is that howard shore is scoring it im excited to hear it and feel it and didnt expect him to get involved to be honest music has always been one of the most important aspects of filmmaking to me personally

"1317",51206,5,"/r/lotr",1,"I’m British, we’ve had plenty of series depicting our own history and real historic figures, being portrayed by Black or non White actors. They actually released a series recently that caused some uproar, where they cast a Black actress to portray Anne Boleyn. I can understand how certain fictional characters can be portrayed by non white actors, but to portray a well known, historic, British figure as Black, is just ridiculous. Anne Boleyn was categorically White. The King of England (Henry) would never have married a Black woman. That would never have been allowed even if he wanted to, and going by our knowledge of Henry and those times, that wouldn’t have been likely. There was a story about Queen Victoria simply having a close advisor and friend, Abdul, who happened to be Indian. Her Son nearly had her committed as insane amongst a load of other threats just so she wouldn’t maintain a friendship with an Indian man. I feel like we are entitled to have our own history and culture that shouldn’t have to be diversified. If any historic Black figure, say, Rosa Parks was portrayed in film by a White actress, the uproar would be wild, and none of those expressing anger would be made to feel patronised or “silly” for expressing such feelings. The people who have made complaints about British history and historic figures in film being played by Black actors have been labelled “racists”, yet historical accuracy of culture is respected when it comes to other racial groups.

But I think it’s obvious that the real reason Luke didn’t come himself is because if he did, from a meta/show-writing perspective it would have been incredibly jarring for Luke to be on-planet and not gotten involved in the fight. Not that it would have been bad if he had, hell I really wish he did. But at the end of the day, the writers made the decision that this would be Din and Boba’s fight and Luke would not jump in to save the day. It would have been so weird for Luke to drop Grogu off with some strange woman and then leave without even sensing the incoming battle on his home planet.

"1337",7292,5,"/r/StarWars",0,"Even though I liked the flashbacks, now that I’ve seen the full series I’m very underwhelmed and a little crushed that this is what Boba Fett fans get after all these years.

Whatever combination of responsibilities over the direction of this show, it was pretty appalling considering it’s importance in the Star Wars TV presence. Awkward choreography and performances, lame and slow action sequences. Baffling character choices and logic and missed opportunities all the way through. 

Rodriguez’s fingerprints are all over some of the worst elements of the show but I feel it would be naive to blame him entirely and I can’t help but wonder what Favreau was doing.

Everything about the Mods are terrible. I’ve always known Star Wars to have a very strong fashion bible and every one of those characters and their bikes stuck out like a sore thumb. Sophie Thatcher is literally just dressed as a punk. At least the main male Mod’s outfit felt slightly more like something I’d imagine on Coruscant or Solo’s party yacht. Her performance especially was so distracting, it felt like I was watching a drama school audition. I don’t know Thundercat but every time he appeared it felt like a goofy cameo, especially with the sudden techno in the Dark Angel-like Mod workshop scene.

One thing that been consistent throughout the Mandalorian and now tBoBF, and I don’t see talked about much, is the way both leads’ actions make them seem unbelievably stupid. They walk out into gunfire (without their armour offering enough protection for the situation in which they usually end up knocked on their knees), fall into traps, and usually take a short sighted and flawed path to whatever their objective is. I can’t tell if they’re meant to be written as naive and impulsive but seeing the behaviour now echoed in Boba Fett, I have to assume it comes from the people writing the scripts.

Overall, it was a wasted opportunity and the many things I did enjoy weren’t enough or were half-baked.","even though i liked the flashbacks now that ive seen the full series im very underwhelmed and a little crushed that this is what boba fett fans get after all these years

When you make major changes for diversity’s sake, you could at the very least pay attention to small yet important details. It’s like if the american soldiers in private Ryan were waving the Canadian flag. 

It isn’t just Galadriel. Tolkien was extremely detailed in his work. With a whole page dedicated to describing how eldrond and Arwen look. Both of which had long black hair. Elrond is blonde now for some reason. And the actor looks funky as all hell. 

Isildur’s sister never existed. Tolkien was extremely detailed when it came to family lines. Isildur’s sister shouldn’t be there, as well as a whole other host of characters. 

The hobbits really shouldn’t be as active as they are said to be in this new show. Keep in mind hobbits we’re mostly unknown to middle earth. And they didn’t often leave the shire. Bar tooks and even they left only on occasion. 

Elrond in vanity fair’s description is now a politician or something along those lines. This is the same man that gave up the crown of the noldor.

You have an issue too many people suffer from nowadays. You refuse to look into the depth of the opposition’s argument and simply straw man it as racist. The argument against forced diversity I would say is actually an anti-racist one. 

Hollywood for a long time has done white washing of characters to appeal to their audiences. That’s how we got white Genghis Khan. This is a Northern European setting. So just like how there being a bunch of random white people in Wakanda doesn’t make sense, it doesn’t make sense for middle earth either. If you wanted a majority non white cast the show should have set it in Rhun or Southern Harad. And better yet then they wouldn’t have to worry about details in regards to established characters. They could make entirely new ones while still being cannon to the lore. And they can even include the blue wizards.

"1371",42615,5,"/r/lotr",1,"Absolutely correct.

When people are nervous about things like “diversity casting,” it’s not because they just don’t want to see non-white actors get these kinds of roles. It’s because it’s wrong to simply say “it’s fantasy, so we can do whatever we want.” Casting needs to make sense. People look a certain way for a reason. You can’t just have a random assortment of ethnicities in a single community (such as in Gondor or Rohan) that should, by any measure of reason, actually appear fairly homogenous.

If you want diversity, do it so it makes sense. Introduce characters from Harad, which Tolkien based on the ancient Aethiopians of Sub-Saharan Africa. Introduce the Easterlings of Rhûn or the Variags of Khand, who represent factions of Men based on Asian and Slavic cultures respectively. These are all direct pulls from the pen/typewriter of Tolkien himself. It’s a way of establishing diversity in a way that makes sense. These people have different cultures and appearances because they come from far away places.

I don’t know why this is so difficult for some people to wrap their heads around. There’s nothing wrong with diversity, but there *is* something wrong with casting that seeks to artificially create diversity by completely ignoring all sense of internal logic. It reeks of a production that is choosing to prioritize making a contemporary sociopolitical statement over accurately representing their source material, which makes me question what other compromises were made under the guise of “creative liberty.”

Middle-Earth is intended to be English myth. England is much more ethnically diverse now than it was thousands of years ago, but Middle-Earth is not contemporary England.

1. The Slave one would have endangered the people fighting the droids way more than a rancor (until Bane unleashed it). Like you said: It has a lot of firepower and they haven't been that far away from the fighters.

2. Giving the rancor no armor was maybe not the smartest move of boba (though he does not have the rancor that long), but it made the fight scene much more interesting. Like we already got two characters with literal plot armor - I liked how I wasn't sure if the rancor would survive and also seeing him struggle to beat those droids.

3. Rancors are - as told - fighters and I guess they don't really care, if they can eat what they are fighting (I mean he literally threw away the pikes instead of eating them all). 

4. And this is kind of the best reason for it (even if you don't agree with the other Ones):
Boba knew, that the pikes played all their cards. He just needed to destroy those droids to win. The Slave One and the Rancor were both abled to do so. But he also said it in the first episodes: He intends to rule with respect. And while a guy in a spaceship could have easly beaten two droids, a guy riding a rancor into battle is the one, which is far more respected.

I mean, honestly, look at this trailer for Mahabharata (I'll put the link below) and imagine blond Chris Hemsworth suddenly pop up as one of the characters in the trailer.

Cate Blanchett is one of my favorite actresses and has been for a long time, before LOTR - so I wasn't surprised she was perfect as Galadriel, it would be very hard for anyone to come close to that.

"1407",28146,5,"/r/lotr",1,"You know on the one hand, I completely understand that Tolkien wrote in a different time where there were different values around race and diversity. I also completely understand that at least in the US, there is a diverse market for this type of show. Amazon of course wants to appeal to the broadest possible audience for money, but also everyone does deserve to get to see themselves in this type of thing. I think Tolkien should be for everyone. I grew up watching a white Aragorn kick ass and I loved it. I didn’t love it because he was white of course, but I do get how it’s not something I ever had to think about in terms of the characters in epic fantasy movies looking like me. The race of the character doesn’t matter to me, but I can certainly see the value in broader representation in media.

On the other hand, just write something else. That’s obviously a broader problem with entertainment in general, but like the last original work of sci/fi to get this much money thrown at it was Avatar and that was the most successful movie ever. I know game of thrones was written a while ago, but same story with that being a massively successful show despite there not being a 60 year old franchise already. The market is definitely there for new sci-fi/fantasy. In both cases, millions of people including myself, has our introduction to the franchise through a story we were not familiar with when we first watched.

They’re just gonna be making the same “universes” over and over again. I really feel like it’s just lazy writing. You can sacrifice exposition and character development for “lore” and then I have to see the prequel to the prequel to get it. They’re doing it to Harry Potter, Star Wars, Star Trek, Marvel, hell even to 101 Dalmatians.

It’s so weird that this conversation around reinterpreting Tolkien’s work keeps happening. I like Tolkien, but it’s not the Bible. It’s just a really cool book. There’s no reason to keep beating that dead horse. I like Tolkien, but you know what else I like? Sci-fi and Fantasy. If Amazon was like “Our new $100m fantasy project takes place in the land of Blorko and there are different magical factions going after some goal. There is gonna be a lot of world building and stuff for everyone to geek out about.” Literally most of this subreddit would watch it. It’s the exact same demographic of fans. Can’t be taking risks though. If Bezos loses $100million he might have to start skipping meals.

Tolkien’s work 100% reflect his time. We can learn from that, but we also have good values in our current time. Why adapt something that’s 70 years old to fit our time rather than writing something new?","you know on the one hand i completely understand that tolkien wrote in a different time where there were different values around race and diversity i also completely understand that at least in the us there is a diverse market for this type of show amazon of course wants to appeal to the broadest possible audience for money but also everyone does deserve to get to see themselves in this type of thing i think tolkien should be for everyone i grew up watching a white aragorn kick ass and i loved it i didnt love it because he was white of course but i do get how its not something i ever had to think about in terms of the characters in epic fantasy movies looking like me the race of the character doesnt matter to me but i can certainly see the value in broader representation in media

I see the problem. You're confusing the real-life definition of race (color/origin based) and the Middle Earth definition of race (different species with different physiologies). 

Black elves are still elves. The whole point I'm making is that their skin color wouldn't change that. You're assuming that black elves and white elves would consider themselves separate, but that's only a hangup if you assume the Legendarium follows the patterns of real life society.

Tolkien drew his own mythos from the cultures of the Anglo-Saxons, Norse and pre-industrial England. It was easier to just say white than specifically referring to each culture.

Just because there were black people who lived at the same time and same place does not mean that it is automatically made to include these people directly in the story.

Canonically, Aegon I and his sister-wives Rhaenys and Visenya had a Velaryon mother. Aegon and Rhaenys’s son Aenys then marries his cousin Alyssa Velaryon who is part Massey, but the Masseys are a mix of First Men and Andal (like almost all houses in Westeros) and the description of Andals is that they are tall and fair-haired (so pretty similar to Valyrians since the next common physical traits for Valyrians after silver hair and purple eyes is blue eyes and gold “blonde” hair). Their son and daughter Jaehaerys and Alysanne (who has blue eyes and blonde hair) marry each other. Their son and daughter Baelon and Alyssa marry each other. Their son marries his first cousin Aemma Arryn who is part Andal (Arryn). By the time of the show, the Targaryens actually have more Velaryon ancestry than they do Targaryen ancestry, but this is okay because Velaryons are suppose to be a cousin house similar in looks and ancestry. 

I’m a book nerd and GRRM never made Valyrians Black even though he thought of making Targaryens Black. Instead his book TWOIAF confirms that they were pretty much eugenicists and describes them as being pale. The character Daenaera Velaryon is specifically described as being “white as snow” with blonde hair and blue eyes in F&B and he makes Daella Targaryen, cousin and courtship of Corlys Velaryon, cry the first time she sees a Black man also in F&B. GRRM went in the opposite direction and made Valyrians incest-practicing, blood supremacist white people.    

Furthermore, Westeros as a whole is a pretty racist, xenophobic, and vicious society even to other white people who don’t follow their religion or culture. House Velaryon was the richest at the time and I can’t imagine it wouldn’t be mentioned when in canon, they treat Summer Islanders like “exotic wonders” (see Jalabhar Xho), despise all Essosi no matter what their skin color is, and have a problem with the Dornish even though they are also Westerosi. 

However, I think the change is okay because Corlys is a seafarer in the book and they can change his origins in the show. He could have a mother who is Summer Islander. It doesn’t work canonically, but the show and book are different things.","they are more like the ptolemy dynasty with their custom of marrying brother to sister and they only marry to house velaryon because they were practically the same family and looked the same as them

or

It's a story of an entire, weary world becoming the victim of yet another war in an endless series, and the tale of the land sacrificing its magic to eliminate one great evil.

I choose the latter. Peter Jackson plainly prefers the former. He's a two-dimenisonal guy, all plot. On removing the scouring of the Shire, Jackson said, “At the very beginning of this process, we’d identified the spine of our movies — Frodo taking the Ring to Mordor — which means that the climax of our movies is Frodo destroying the Ring.""

As far as I'm concerned, that is the *plot* of the book, but *not* what it is about. Once you have removed the scouring, once you have given all the hobbits a gleeful return to an untouched Shire (in exchange for a giant, stupid pumpkin), once you have eviscerated any sense of the loss of the elves and the toll taken on Frodo by having the Ring taken from him... at that point, you're no longer telling the same story.

"1554",20952,5,"/r/StarWars",0,"I suppose that’s a fair point. A good part of my perception about the “let the past die” theme beyond Kylo’s arc comes from Luke, mostly. 

In the very first opening scene, he tosses the lightsaber over his shoulder. He tells Rey to let the past die and let the Jedi die. Later, Yoda lights the tree on fire and we get that awesome “but the sacred texts!” line which sort of reinforced that idea. And while Luke had the “let the past die” attitude, the key difference between his outlook and Kylo’s comes from the conclusion of that quote: “kill it if you have to”. Kylo wanted to burn it down. Luke wanted it to disappear. But Rey saw the potential to become something more. 

Overall I took the theme as letting the past go, because that is integral to moving forward. But you can’t just kill it like Kylo wants to. Learning from what you’ve done is the key to evolving and becoming better. Yoda knew the Jedi made huge mistakes, which i feel was symbolized in his burning of the tree. Luke tried to replicate the Jedi of the Republic, but the whole concept was flawed. He needed to let the past die, for the order to become something more.

"1557",14378,5,"/r/StarWars",0,"The finale got Rodriguezed. What a terrible disappointment. 

Especially after two outstanding episodes. 

Once again, nobody made any sense. The decision to fight in the city didn’t make sense. He was convinced by a biker that he doesn’t know and certainly doesn’t trust that staying in the city to protect the people is the way to go. Which is a silly argument with no merit to begin with, much less to agree with. The syndicate was after Boba and his gang, if they left the city, the people of the city would be safe. Staying is what endangers them. She knew that. And so did Boba. So from that moment on, I am not believing the story. 

Once again fights so bad. 

From running down the middle of the street, and not grabbing shelter (the biker leader says she knows the city yet we never see her use the city to her advantage, not offensively or defensively). To the greatest crazy stupid nonsense I’ve ever seen, nobody fires on the droids when their shields are down. When they first see them, they all watch them come down the street unshielded. Why? Waiting to see whose side they’re on? But the second those shields go up, they never stop firing. Can nobody on this squad learn? It’s insane. Watching Mando try three times with the dark saber made me literally scream. The fuck did he think would happen the third time? Then he says something about if you’re slow enough, you can pass through the shield. But doesn’t try until the very end. And then doesn’t go slow at all. He just jumps through. And once the shields are down, the crew who up until this point never stopped firing at the shields, now they all stop. And not only do they all stop firing, we cut to them several times just watching from behind their wall. To show off just how much they aren’t firing on the unshielded droid. Guh. 

Let’s talk about relative speed, something Rodriguez knows nothing about. We saw a bit of this in the train episode, but here it’s more egregious. We know how fast the droids can move, and we know how fast a speeder can move, yet every time the speeder turns a corner and gets away, they turn around and there’s a droid. Can the droids teleport? Or have burst speed? Or something? If they do, shouldn’t they have shown that? At least once? Even the group running down the street was running faster than the droid, yet they could never quite lose it. 

Cad Bane vs. a rancor? With only a flamethrower? C’mon. And Boba gets knocked into buildings, thrown upside down by a droid while riding a rancor, but when the rancor recoils from fire? That’s when he gets thrown? C’mon. That rancor runs rampant all over town, not afraid of anyone, not even Mando (or his flamethrower. In his mouth!) and it’s afraid of Cad Bane? Why? What am I watching?

I still can’t get over everybody firing at the shields. 

Why was Fennec a ghost/ninja in Mos Eisley. But can’t take out six guys walking in the open in a street in Mos Espa?

Every time a piece of the city gets destroyed I wonder why they weren’t fighting from the cover of Jabba’s palace. How is this fight in their streets helping these people?

I’m not going to talk about Boba and the rancor getting to the fight so fast or Grogu showing up by himself (with R2?) in Luke’s X-Wing or why Dan Dority implied that Vance was dead or how two of Boba’s three gangs somehow survived their ambushes, because all of that could be explained with some convoluted reasoning. But it all pushes credulity. 

At least Boba had his helmet on for most of the fighting.","the finale got rodriguezed what a terrible disappointment

It's also demongraphic based... plenty of younger people will be doing this, whilst older people won't be.

I don't treat Tolkien's work as 'any action movie'. It's far more than, say, a Transformers movie.

However, we don't have any indication that Amazon's series is doing this. In fact, what we know seems to indicate that they're not shying away from the biblical/mythological fantasy that Tolkien paints these eras with. Thats why I bring up the War of Wrath and Valinor. 

That said, of course it could happen. In fact, I can't imagine to some extent that they wouldn't.

I finally watched episode 7 last night and am posting my gut reaction after sleeping on it. The show just wasn't really good to be honest. It was a mess of a story with the best, most exciting parts being the episodes Boba wasn't even a part of. 🤷‍♂️

I agree with the Star Wars Theory review of the show. I think they could've saved episode 5/6 for Mando S3. As much as I loved seeing Luke with Grogu, Ashoka with Mando, Luke with Ashoka, it took far too much focus away from the main characters. Then when they swung back to Boba on episode 7 and Grogu just showed up, it sort of made the whole side trip to Luke pointless in many ways. I think the whole fight that happened in episode 7 could've been done in an earlier episode - it just didn't seem like the best use of it or the proper ending of the show. 

Overall, they should've focused more on Boba and Fennec to learn more about them, and build them up more as characters, as crime lords with a bit of a heart.

>You can make the female dwarves beardless. I’d have preferred to see them with beards, but are you going to tell me the narrative of the LotR hinges on the facial hair of women dwarves who don’t even feature in the story? Really?

Nice strawman. I rejected your importance of narrative. There is no need for narrative around looks of beings. Dwarves' height or bulkiness is not important to the story narrative. Elves having pointy ears is not important to the story either. Narrative is irrelevant.

And your argument goes both ways. How blackwashing dwarves and elves is important to the story? It is not.

If we're going off of Tolkien's writings in the the first book Legolas was light enough to walk on top of snow, and in the series he could see farther than anyone. In the Nature of Middle Earth Tolkien wrote:   


""Thus the Quendi did not and do not ""live slowly"", moving ponderously like tortoises, while Time flickers past them and their sluggish thoughts! Indeed, they move and think swifter than Men, and achieve more than a Man in any given length of time. \* But they have a far greater native vitality and energy to draw upon, so that it takes and will take a very great length of time to expend it.  
\* But not on a wholly different time-scale. Thus to a Man Elves appear to speak rapidly but clearly (unless they retard their speech for Men's sake), to move quickly and featly (**unless they are in urgency, or much moved, when the movement of their hands, for example, may become too swift for human eyes to follow closely**), and only their thought, perception, and reasoning seem normally beyond human speed. ""

\-Page 23, the Nature of Middle Earth Emphasis mine.   


That outright says that they are not only capable of percieving things faster than Men can, but they are outright faster to the point that Men can't even follow it. More than fast enough, imo, to see and catch an arrow out of the air.   


Also, saying that 'reflect the world' opens the door to them putting in cellphones or guns or tik-tok or whatever other thing this argument constantly inserts is a strawman. The color of character's skin or the style of a character's hair doesn't affect the world or the story. Not in Tolkien's world. It might break immersion and not line up perfectly, but it doesn't affect the story. It might look silly and out of place, but it doesn't change anything. Those things would directly change the story and the world on a direct and significantly impactful scale. Gandalf, afterall, would have just been able to ride the eagles with his AK-47 and shoot down the Nazgul. He could have called Frodo and let him know what was going on, he could have called and let the Fellowship know what was happening. Directly changing the story.  


If Gandalf had been clean shaven and black, the story wouldn't have changed. He just wouldn't have been an accurate adaptation of his description in the book.","changing hairstyles and changing age are the exact same type of change though it is by and large inconsequential sure the hairstyle not being long and with the lore will bother people and pull them out of their immersion so did frodo being younger and him not waiting around years in the shire after gandalf told him about the ring they ultimately do not change the story being told the elf being puerto rican and the dwarf being black and beardless though i do wish they had given her a beard also ultimately do not change the story or the world

Overall, the trailer (and some other material I've seen/heard) has a bit of a ""kiddy"" feel to it. Like I'm watching Narnia or something, though, perhaps there are better examples out there.

I dislike the idea that all negative feedback must be rooted in ignorance, entitlement, elitism, racism, or some other undesirable or toxic trait.

i hope im wrong but it is entirely fair for fans to be disappointed in what weve seen and i dont think many would put their money on amazons series being much more than a forgettable generic fantasy with lotr slapped on the promotional material"

Bilbo basically insults everyone saying he doesn't like 99% of everyone there. But he says it in such a way that also illustrates how stupid they are and avoids them realizing they've almost all been insulted at his party.

The basic idea is: Bilbo thinks half of them suck and deserve it. He thinks the other half (but not all) let's say 49% also suck. But Bilbo guesses that the 49% probably don't **deserve** his disdain. So maybe his dislike of them is his problem and not their problem. And there is an unknown percent, but very small, that he actually does like, the 1%.

He essentially says this:

I don't like 50% of you. I also don't like most of the other 50% of you. But you probably deserve to be liked better by me, but I don't like you regardless.

This then also implies there is some small section of the second half of people who Bilbo actually does like. But he doesn't give a specific number. He basically hates 50% of them, hates the other half of them too minus a small select few, but admits that his dislike of the second half is probably not their fault.","its pretty simple actually

I think this is, in a way, Johnson's commentary on that?

Either way, I think Snoke's handling in TFA and TLJ is really interesting, imo.","totally fair read

"1867",20822,5,"/r/StarWars",0,"I felt they could have made Kylo a lot more menacing, with a scene or two near the beginning of the third film. They could have used those scenes to demonstrate how far down Kylo has gone, and how powerful he has become. And maybe with the good guys, have them mention a couple of terrible things Kylo's done since TLJ ended.

Combine that with Rey having built her own double lightsaber, Finn having been taught a bit how to be a jedi (but weaker than Rey). Maybe Finn helps her open up after her being traumatized by the back and forth with Kylo. Leia could still have been training them near the beginning of the film, and die early on to give them that feeling that they're truly alone now.

You could even still include Hux turning on Kylo at a pivotal point, with Hux thinking it's his chance to finally take charge. But instead it weakens the First Order to the point that the good guys stand a chance. It would be epic to see the First Order star ships turn against each other in a big space battle.

And I would have loved to see remnants of the New Republic finally mustered. Because the idea that the entire Republic fleet would have been entirely destroyed in TFA is ludicrous. They never would have had their entire military all in one place.

Anyway, sorry for the rambling. But I think those aspects could have made for a better 3rd film.","i felt they could have made kylo a lot more menacing with a scene or two near the beginning of the third film they could have used those scenes to demonstrate how far down kylo has gone and how powerful he has become and maybe with the good guys have them mention a couple of terrible things kylos done since tlj ended

"1906",29589,5,"/r/lotr",1,"1) As the others have said, it’s largely a matter of runtime. 
2) Too many subplots in a long movie can be confusing, I suppose, and a degree of focus is always necessary. Which leads me to my next point: 
3) Denethor’s character is sacrificed on an altar, so to speak, that quickly justifies to the audience why Aragorn’s coronation is so necessary. Everything in the movie points to Gondor in decline — her white sepulcher aesthetic, her massive ruins (e.g. Osgiliath), even minor details like the trebuchets using giant slabs of rubble instead of normal projectiles, or her soldiers getting absolutely bodied by Mordor in every scene they’re in. Denethor likewise is depicted as a poor substitute for a king, so when Aragorn is coronated there’s a catharsis for the audience: King Elessar will put things right and lead Gondor back to glory and prosperity.","as the others have said its largely a matter of runtime

"1916",5209,5,"/r/StarWars",0,"I keep saying it because none of those involved the person’s body actively sitting in front of the person who killed them. Give me one good reason why Boba wouldn’t check to make sure he’s really dead in this case. It’s not because he ran off right away, we watched him linger there. I don’t buy that Bane is capable of hiding his aliveness from arguably the greatest bounty hunter in the galaxy, all while not expecting Boba to stab him with the staff. 

The other characters coming back were questionable, but Fennec was at least intended by the writers to come back. Maul had no business, but his death wasn’t as important to the story as Bane’s would be to wrapping up Boba’s story. 

Palpatine didn’t technically survive his, that was a clone, still stupid though.

We were specifically shown Anakin surviving, that scene was literally meant to show that Obi Wan did t finish the job. 

Boba wasn’t even killed on purpose, he was just in the way. 

The Anakin is the only one kind of relevant, since he was at Obi Wan’s mercy. The writers were in a bind there though, since somehow they had to have Obi Wan maim the shit out of him but not kill him.

If they wanted to bring back Cad Bane, there’s no reason they would have used a scene that requires such a suspension of disbelief on Boba’s part. Have Boba shoot him, then all hell breaks loose, and show that he crawled away after if you want him to stay alive? Why would they make a point of showing Boba has him at his complete mercy, just for him to somehow become an idiot that doesn’t check to make sure he’s really killed someone.

The only way it works is for some reason Boba wants to keep him alive, or they show a flashback of someone immediately chasing Boba away from the body. I’m not saying he’s fully dead on screen, but he’s as good as with all the information we have.

Plus narratively, it just makes sense for his story to end at the conclusion of Boba’s show. Their rivalry was literally built up for this purpose.

>What do you mean by this?

Sorry let me explain. What I mean is that there’s no objective measure of what a character definitively would and wouldn’t do in every situation. We have an idea of who a character is but that’s only on the basis of experience of them, so while of course someone can say “I don’t believe Luke Skywalker would do that”, I don’t think they can day “Luke Skywalker would never do that” as an objective fact. In my view characters are too complicated to make definitive statements like that. Luke in the OT was often unwise, quick to anger, and prone to moodiness and depressions. He didn’t just have positive traits, and importantly when we see him in the flashbacks of The Last Jedi, this isn’t the same Luke we knew. He’s lived a whole life we haven’t seen. So I don’t think we can really say he was acting out of character definitively. 

>It has been awhile since I have seen TLJ, but when was this established?

Well Luke says it directly, when he’s talking to Rey about what happened with Ben he says that after The OT “I became a legend” and “Leia blames Snoke, but it was me. I failed- **because I was Luke Skywalker, Jedi Master**.” I think it’s clear from this and the way he says it that prior to Ben’s fall he believed his own legend, and didn’t think any of this could ever happen to him.","what do you mean by this

Harad, Khand and other areas though are majority populated by black or Asian people and at various points in history those areas were closely linked with the ones we see in PJs movies. 

Areas of Harad were part of the kingdom of Gondor, the Numenorians had cities there. Easterlings are also supposed to have traded/raided the lands of men too. 

All this suggests to me that if anything there would be more diversity in middle earth than medieval Europe, especially in the centres of empire like Numenor itself. Rome would be a good example, plenty of north Africans would have travelled or lived there due to the influences of the empire.

"1980",47650,5,"/r/lotr",1,">	Oh okay you invented a made up hypothetical thing to get mad at it. Cool.

What?

I know I made up a hypothetical. That’s the point of a hypothetical. I created an example to illustrate the circumstances of my point of view.

I’m not mad about it. I’m arguing that, especially in LOTR, the story benefits from explaining how people end up where they do. It’s part of the fun. Dumping an odd person in a place where they stick out is a recipe for questions. Why deny that?

I’m explicitly arguing that there needs to be good justification for people being where they are. I’m not sure why you seem to have this idea that I’m against Haradrim existing - I just don’t see the value in pretending that, for example, it is normal to see them wandering about Rivendell.

>	The stories you guys wanna see sound boring. Everything stays totally the same all the time and nothing out of the ordinary occurs.

Again, what’s with the strawman? It’s like you aren’t even reading, just reacting.

>	In my opinion, never let ""rules"" get in the way of an interesting story.

In my opinion, rules are what make stories interesting. The extreme restriction and wild landscapes of middle earth make travel all the more exciting to read about, in a way that makes the fellowship of dwarf, elf, hobbit and man even more rare and thus remarkable.

Ignoring rules and going for ‘what looks cool’ would rob the grounded nature of the work.","oh okay you invented a made up hypothetical thing to get mad at it cool
