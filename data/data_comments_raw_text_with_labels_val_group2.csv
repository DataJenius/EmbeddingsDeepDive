I want to offer you my sympathies; I know how hard it is to watch someone waste away under hospice. I'm going to try to temper my response, because I know that this sort of thing messes with your cognition, and you aren't thinking clearly with relation to that.

People dying, even by the thousands each year, is not a reason to restrict the rights and freedoms of 330,000,000 people (just in the continental USA alone). More people die of obesity-related, smoking-related, alcohol-related, and car-related causes (heart attacks, stroke, lung cancer, cirrhosis, car accidents, etc.) per year then have died during the entire covid ""pandemic"". You never hear people argue that we must restrict all access and rights to unhealthy food, alcohol, legal smoking products (which is on an UPWARD TREND for fucks sake because of all the marijuana addicts clamoring to be legalized), cars, etc. due to these deaths.

And make no mistake, each and every one of those deaths is a ""personal choice"" death, not a ""lightning from a blue sky"" deaths.

Covid restrictions and mandates make no sense, except when viewed through an economic lens for the massive profits made for Pfizer and Moderna in the last two years (the latter of which, curiously, had literally never had a successful product until their covid ""vaccine"" was pre-purchased by the hundreds of millions by governments using our tax dollars)."

Also, here's what the literal founder of facism and other facists in Europe considered it to be.   


""Mussolini established the first fascist regime, followed soon after by others, including Nazi Germany. Fascism, however, differed somewhat from one nation to another. Thus, scholars often disagree on a precise definition of fascism. Even so, they tend to agree on its common characteristics such as:
  


* Absolute Power of the State: Fascist regimes have a strong centralized state, or national government. The fascist state seeks total control over all major parts of society. Individuals must give up their private needs and rights to serve the needs of the whole society as represented by the state.
  

* Rule by a Dictator: A single dictator runs the fascist state and makes all the important decisions. This leader often uses charisma, a magnetic personality, to gain the support of the people.
  

* Corporatism: Fascists believe in taming capitalism by controlling labor and factory owners. Unions, strikes, and other labor actions are illegal. Although private property remains, the state controls the economy.
  

* Extreme Nationalism: The fascist state uses national glory and the fear of outside threats to build a new society based on the “common will” of the people. Fascists believe in action and looking at national myths for guidance rather than relying on the “barren intellectualism” of science and reason.
  

* Superiority of the Nation’s People: Fascists hold up the nation’s people as superior to other nationalities. They typically strengthen and unify the dominant group in a nation while stifling dissent and persecuting minority groups.
  

* Militarism and Imperialism: Fascists believe that great nations show their greatness by conquering and ruling weak nations. Fascists believe the state can survive only if it successfully proves its military superiority in war.""

Even then Trump only ticks 2 of them at most and that's a stretch and a half.

>Oh… by the way, first time in what… 20 years that America
  
was not in some form of a conflict?

Completely false.  We have troops engaged throughout the world in counter-terrorism conflict.

>Then again, I am of the belief that having a strong America
  
that is proactive in squashing problems leads to a more peaceful world. I do
  
not believe we should be in pro-longed conflicts that drain money

Needlessly surrendering to the Taliban doesn't make the world more peaceful.  Pulling back American leadership as the global police doesn't make the world more peaceful.  Go look up Pax Americana and come back here."

Many of them still abusing their platforms with propaganda to continue doing whatever the hell it is they’re trying to do (like Candace Owens, look into her history before she became a far-right pundit.)

The difference though, is Twitter, Facebook, etc aren’t advertising themselves to be “a platform for free speech.” Like the dude screaming TRUTH at you is.

So the evidence lies in the TOS as to what their intentions are, which is a curated feed intended to continue to spread whatever info they deem is of benefit to their message they’re trying to convince you of.

Before you say “well the other companies do that too”, duh, that’s part of the problem with social media as a whole. Unfortunately we’ve built algorithms that focus on maximizing profit from ads as that’s where social media companies get most of their revenue. Human psychology is more likely to interact with posts that upset them, leading to an abundance of sensationalized articles about negative topics filled with ads that generate revenue just by you scrolling through the article.

Hence an economic collapse and all the problems that come with it (supply chain issues, inflation, depression, drug use). My personal opinion is that we should have had three clear approaches at three distinct steps: 1. When the virus first broke out, ask people to reduce their socialization to help contain the spread, for maybe 2-4 weeks. 2. Return to business as usual with mask requirements until a vaccine was developed, again to reduce the spread. 3.

(hint: we shall)

""The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes.... Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.""

""A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercises, I advise the gun. While this gives moderate exercise to the body, it gives boldness, enterprise and independence to the mind. Games played with the ball, and others of that nature, are too violent for the body and stamp no character on the mind. Let your gun therefore be your constant companion of your walks."" - Thomas Jefferson, letter to Peter Carr, August 19, 1785

""The Constitution of most of our states (and of the United States) assert that all power is inherent in the people; that they may exercise it by themselves; that it is their right and duty to be at all times armed.""
- Thomas Jefferson, letter to to John Cartwright, 5 June 1824

""The supposed quietude of a good man allures the ruffian; while on the other hand, arms, like law, discourage and keep the invader and the plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property. The balance ofpower is the scale of peace. The same balance would be preserved were all the world destitute of arms, for all would be alike; but since some will not, others dare not lay them aside. And while a single nation refuses to lay them down, it is proper that all should keep them up. Horrid mischief would ensue were one-half the world deprived of the use of them; for while avarice and ambition have a place in the heart of man, the weak will become a prey to the strong. The history of every age and nation establishes these truths, and facts need but little arguments when they prove themselves.""

Biden slapped on a bunch of sanctions on Russia this morning. Basically he banned two banks and a bunch of oligarchs from trading in the US and Europe, shut down nord stream 2 and said US and Europe will not give them any new finance. In essence he did a light version of what Trudeau is doing to the truckers in Canada. Oh and despite these sanctions Europe and the US will still continue to buy gas and oil from Russia.


  
To be honest these sanctions are a joke. First all these people would have moved their funds a long time ago in preparation for this. Second if you cannot get China on board the sanctions have no weight. So they cannot trade in Europe and US. They just go to the Hong Kong stock exchange. Need to borrow funds? Just do what the US and Europe do. Go borrow from China.

 
  
Its not the 1990’s where the US and allies had a complete monopoly on finances. Russia can easily bypass any sanctions and a weak and impotent Biden will not have the resolve to force China’s hand. Russia and China are laughing at him. 


  
And as a final point, this would not have happened under Trump. Most people know this but the left will never admit it. Why this would have never happened under Trump is because his sanctions would actually hurt Russia. He made the US energy independent and a net exporter. He was dead set against nord stream 2 and the reliance US and Europe had on Russia for oil and gas. He would have crippled Russia into submission by taking Europe’s dependence on them and starving their oil and gas industries. Instead a weak Biden who shut down Keystone is dependent on the very country he is sanctioning."

Then in my senior year I had to drive a 78 suburban with a big block 396, 8 MPG, but it did 8mpg no matter what you did to it. 40 gallon tank, so about $70 to fill up, but I could go anywhere, and with the money I was making working in a warehouse throwing dog food around, I could easily afford it.

Now, with fuel edging up to $4 again... I'm considering converting one of my cars to EFI, to get the fuel economy as high as possible. Some would say ""just buy a new car!""

EFI on a 10:1 compression small block, aluminum heads, the right cam, and the .68 overdrive 3.73:1 gears, in my 3200 lbs Monte Carlo will net me better fuel economy than a brand new camaro, and a faster car to boot! Don't even get me started on how much better it looks, then you have insurance costs, maintenance, tags are cheaper, too. $7.50 yearly inspection, opposed to the $70-something on top of taxes (Texas prices).

2243,"hxv12h8",2,1,"/r/Conservative","I enjoyed it, but they completely destroyed the thought experiment Heinlein was engaged in.  Heinlein was musing as to whether or not citizenship should come at a price, whether or not true citizenship should require you make some kind of investment into the community as a whole.  It was a means to prevent ungrateful masses to simply vote from the government's coffers into their own bank accounts.  To become a citizen, you had to have some skin in the game.  In the book, a common way to ""give"" to the community and earn citizenship was to serve in the military (although it was not the ONLY means).  The leftist filmmakers simplified this to an easy, ""Government fascist, would you like to know more?""  

It is important to note that Heinlein didn't require you to necessarily provide something of substance (like military service) for citizenship, rather you just had to demonstrate a willingness to work towards the good of your society as a whole.  Like I said, it was an interesting thought experiment which could make for great debates (I have to read it again, it has been a while).

They also just completely changed key messages.  Remember the guy at the recruiting station who was missing a leg, who stated the mobile infantry, ""made me the man I am today"".  The movie used it as proof that the fascist government doesn't care for the well being of the soldiers.  In the book he is later met by the protagonists with his top of the line prosthetics.  He explains that he doesn't wear them at reception specifically so that recruits understand the stakes.  If they join out of ignorance, it is not worthy of citizenship.  They must willingly partake in the risk to show they deserve a path to citizenship.

Remember the knife in the hand scene, in the book it was an interesting monologue about the use of appropriate force.  It was well thought out and reasoned.

Others may disagree with my take on the book, and as I said it has been a while since I read it, but it was so much more than ""Government fascist and bad"".  If you read it, you may not agree with Heinlein's proposition, but man oh man is it so much deeper than the (admittedly enjoyable) movie.


EDIT: My goodness that's a block of text,  sorry for the long reply.  I guess I really resent the twisting of that book.

TLDR:  The book is a very nuanced thought experiment, the movie actively tries to ridicule those thoughts in a great action movie."

1\. Once again, ""classical liberal"" and ""clearly on our side of the aisle"" are not mutually exclusive terms. A classical liberal can be either conservative or progressive. In the case of Dave Rubin, he seemed to move from progressive to conservative (due to woke cancel culture) while remaining fundamentally a classical liberal the entire time ([Allen 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utv4yDYFZX4)). In that interview, the host Virginia Allen remarked how classical liberals must be shocked at what wokeism has done to that side of the fence. ""What happened to my party?"" liberals must be asking themselves, she said.

""Well, they’re conservatives now,"" Rubin replied. ""I mean, that really is the truth."" And there he touches on a point that often goes unnoticed. See, I don't think people like Rubin or Joe Rogan have moved away from the left, really, so much as the left has moved a great deal further left in their rabid pursuit of progressive extremism. With the lefties pushing so much further left, what was center-left 20 years ago is now considered center-right. Progressive extremists pushed radically left while everyone else basically remained where they were. Classical liberals, Rubin said, know that ""liberalism in that sense has been destroyed"" by the lefties, that the left ""has run roughshod over all the things that they cared about.""

2\. It is not disingenuous to consider him a liberal when he self-identifies as such (ibid.), talking about his ""good liberal roots."" (He sells a ""Classical Liberal"" t-shirt on his show's merchandizing web page.) He's just unabashed about being a conservative one."

It’s not even just this new wave of authoritarianism, if you think America is divided we are so much worse. This government and the Social Dems actively encouraged BLM rioters when they tore down statues of our founding father and decapitated them. I know Americans aren’t fond of royalty but we are (generally) and BLM also tore down a statue of Queen Victoria who was (for the time) a great Monarch and granted us our independence. The leader of the NDP (Social Dems) said [“our Canada is a place of racism”](https://youtu.be/i94sA64VzMA) and he and JT now view pride in our flag as “white supremacy”

That’s just the social side our economy is even worse. Our cities rank amongst the least affordable *on the planet* because of brain dead Liberal policies. To them the idea of us all living in single family homes is pure evil, so they demand we all live in shoebox condos and cram ourselves into 3 cities. They then turn around and are stunned that CoL is skyrocketing. 

[**Housing debt makes up 96% of our GDP**](https://betterdwelling.com/canadian-mortgage-debt-reached-96-of-gdp-growth-beginning-to-slow/amp/) according to a recent study and our average home price is currently $750,000 nationally and $1.2M in the 3 previously mentioned cities. Additionally housing increases at a rate of *20-30% / yr on average*, some areas like here in Toronto are even worse. My parents bought their home for $1.2M 2 years ago, and their neighbour just sold their smaller house for $1.9M. 

Our Liberal government also continues to import **1.3M people every 2-3 years** because 5 foreigners have no problem living together in $700,000 condo. It also serves the purpose of suppressing wages which is by design. Of course if you point any of this out you’re a “racist”.

Our only competitive advantage was our natural resources but the left has utterly gutted that industry. Last year they allowed rioters to attack and harass employees building a pipeline through aboriginal land the locally elected chiefs voted to approve. Not to mention the lumber industry which is obviously vital in building housing, but the left says it’s evil too.

You’d think all of the above would make the Left extremely unpopular but nope, their cultishness puts Democrats’ to shame. Their only response is either “ABC!” (Anyone but Conservative) or “can you imagine how bad things would be if the Cons were in power?”. 

There isn’t even any hope really of a Conservative minority government because in the Parliamentary system unless you win a majority, the reigning party gets to ask the house to form government first. If the other parties agree the ruling (Liberal) party is still in power despite losing the election. The NDP leader has also said he will *never* support a Con government ergo he will back JT until the end unless the Cons win a majority which is unlikely.

Them declaring Martial Law is basically just the natural end point of all these policies and their hatred for those not like them. If you read the /r/Ontario threads on the truckers their hated is on full display, I’ve seen comments calling for them to be hanged.

Timing is pretty suspect considering it coincides with major global events (Russia, Econ downturn, potential China-Taiwan). Furthermore, the coordination and funding of Canada's convoy was beyond suspicious- especially considering the sizable involvement of French-Canadian (Quebec Separatists perhaps). Regardless of what's going on (maybe it is really grassroots), the window was kind of missed and the convoy on DC will be an optics disaster. 

Canada just got crushed due to the convoy, why would things be any different here? Canada, a nation with limited infrastructure, effectively zero military, only a couple major ports and border crossings, could effectively be completely blockaded and starved out, yet instead everyone capitulated and they're not effectively under martial law. Here, a nation with extensive infrastructure and grotesquely funded military, is going to somehow capitulate to a blockade of DC (an abandoned ghetto)?  Could, you know, go help blockade Canada but would strangely prefer to all convoy to DC...why? 

Here's why! Because the media wants it. Imagine convincing your viewers that DC is the centralized authority and that their salvation radiates from that disgusting pit. Never mind the people that serve and keep the nation running, your salvation and food stampies come from our heros (like AOC) in DC. Now imagine getting these nice shots of ""Evil White Supremacist Terrorist Insurrectionists"" in front of OUR Democracy! Sells their image much better than, ""Evil  Drumpft supporters blockade various ports and border crossings cutting off food supply and reminding us all that they (the workers) have power, not the embezzlers in DC""...Yeah, I don't think their base would like that realization.

3149,"hxwlr3w",2,1,"/r/Conservative","Canada doesn't elect a Prime Minister.

Each electoral district, a riding, votes for its representative in the federal government (a Member of Parliament aka MP). The leader of the political party with the most elected MPs is asked by the Governor General to form a government, and the party's leader becomes Prime Minister.

The government needs the support of a majority of MPs to pass any laws. Usually Canada has a ""majority"" government, where the party in power has over 50% of the seats in Parliament.

Trudeau actually has a ""minority"" government, meaning his party won the most seats but not 50% + 1. His legislation is passed only through the cooperation of another party's MPs.

As for voting from east to west, that's essentially how it works in practice.

Ridings are all roughly equal in population. So in the heavily populated areas of Canada, urban Ontario and Quebec, there are a lot more ridings than anywhere else.

Polls close I think at 7pm local time. But 7pm in the west is 10pm in the east. Given the headstart on counting, and the massive disparity in population, federal elections are usually mathematically won by seats in the east before the polls even close on the west coast.

This means you get a government that perpetually focuses on the east, as that is its voter base.

Trudeau turned the vote on emergency powers into a vote of confidence. Meaning, if the vote did not pass, then another election would be called. Not for Trudeau, but for the MPs, who don't want to face an election during a popular uprising.

So while some Liberal MPs would have voted against emergency powers, their sense of self preservation was stronger, and thus begrudgingly voted for them instead. He effectively twisted their arm into giving him emergency powers.

Threatening North Korea into submission got us the closest we've been to ending the Korean War since the 50s.

Yet somehow Obama managed to stand by and watch Putin take over Crimea 3 years before his term ended, and now we watch Biden stand by and watch Putin recognize what are effectively Russian puppet governments in Ukraine. No way to blame Bush for Crimea, now there's no way to blame Trump for the recognition after Biden's obvious diplomatic failure with Putin in France. Russia saw their opportunity after Biden's Saigon 2.0 and now they're taking it. China will probably do the same with Taiwan in the near future. 

I'm not here to defend Ukraine either. They are equally bad on taking down opposition in the press, yet the Democrats in DC will clamor for a proxy war with Russia to defend Ukraine because they are a ""democracy"" and are in the process of entering NATO.

The NATO civil budget is $328 million, and the military budget is $1.77 billion.

The US contributes about 16% of the NATO budget, as does Germany, with each paying $335.7M.  That's about 33% right there.  There are 28 other countries in NATO splitting the remaining 67%.

For reference, the US military budget is $778 billion, which exceeds the next 11 national military budgets combined.  The US share of the NATO budget 0.04% of the US military budget, or 0.0016% of the national GDP.

In other news, everything Trump says is always a lie, and you can safely assume the opposite is always the truth.

The lie of omission that Trump pulled this time is that the % GDP is based on their *total military spending*, not their NATO contribution.  The US and Greece both spend a large portion of their GDP on military.  3.7% GDP for the US, and ~2.7% for Greece.

if her father is the primary on the insurance there are some things he has access to.  He can see the plans accumulators and he can confirm responsibility for claims to a limited degree, but it's illegal for him to obtain the specifics of any medical claim under her, or anything she talks to her insurance about without her full consent with very limited usually emergency situations.

Dude should be reported to his local medical board, and your niece should call his insurance provider or plan administrator and ask to remove any PHI authorization on file and ask them to put warning on her file about her dad's activity to try and deter future fraudulent PHI auths from showing up.  Insurance companies take this shit very seriously, if the father is getting private information illegally the insurance company can be held liable if he went through their channels to get it, so her mentioning potential fraud will perk their ears right the fuck up, even the bad insurance companies.

Also if this is her insurance and not her being a dependent on his insurance, that's an entire other batch of holy shit illegal.  Like if you aren't the primary on a plan, I can't even acknowledge the member has insurance with us without their express written or verbal consent.  The dad in that theoretical case is breaking so many laws he should really be in jail at that point.

And he's not alone. He's not unusual. In the 2020 Democratic primary, Democratic voters voter for Biden. Black voters in particular are more likely to be moderate on the actual issues (this is related to higher religiosity among black Democrats compared to white Democrats). This leads them to stay home more often than voting R, but swinging from voting D to not voting is still a swing that changes outcomes, particularly in this era of hyper partisan voter turnout. A huge number of Americans also just don't pay attention and they basically guess when they vote, or vote on a whim. The quality of ads really effects them,. because they tend to go with the last thing they see/hear.

Yeah we levied some sanctions back then, and added crimea to the ofac sanctions list, but now Russia just lost their most important economic project, which is going to bring the pain to Russia.

Here’s why people lap that shit up: the sense of American pride, nationalism, and superiority mixed in with a sense of fear and/or disdain. People are concerned about the border crisis, they think it’s a threat to security, the economy, and our way of life, and they look down on the migrants. They also look down on Mexico and Latin America as a whole. It isn’t such a leap, tbh Mexico isn’t nearly as powerful or stable as the US or Canada, however it is extremely bigoted. 

Trump in that quote is basically facepalming himself for not doing the exact same thing Putin is doing in Ukraine but at the Texas border. By him insinuating that we should just take over a swath of Mexico, not only does this satiate people’s fears over peace and security of the nation (which are already somewhat unfounded, but not entirely - cartel activity is a SIGNIFICANT security and safety risk and saying otherwise is naive), but it also gives people a sense of justice and goodwill, people think they are liberators and are going to give people better lives and strengthen America by adding more territory. Now, it’s easy to then state “these republicans could give a rats ass about liberating Mexicans they’d rather they all just fuck off” and that would be true for a small amount of Republicans, but not for most. Most republicans genuinely do not see themselves as racist and bear no ill will to minorities (in their heads) however they don’t realize how their actions and/or thoughts are bigoted. Then when you call them a racist they become offended because they genuinely do not believe that they are and feel insulted. This further ostracizes them and pushes them away from agreeing with liberal ideologies because they’ve effectively been branded negatively, deserving or otherwise, which then makes them believe that liberals are these insane cancel culture freaks and that, in fact, they are the rational ones. 

I say all this because there is this sentiment among liberals today that Republican ideology can just be written off as stupid or idiotic and then move on. If you’re wondering why American polarization is at an all time high, this is what liberals are contributing to it. In order to make an effective argument against someone, and in order to change their minds, you must understand fully where the other side is coming from in order to effectively either dismantle it, or incorporate what the other side is saying that makes sense and dismantle what doesn’t. This goes for both sides of the aisle. Simply writing it off as idiotic doesn’t assuage any concerns and just pushes people away from each other. 

There’s a reason why Trump was almost re-elected, so many Americans have concerns that Trump was frighteningly effective at addressing. Without understanding why Trump was elected, and why he was almost re-elected, America is going to be stuck in this left-right feud for years to come, which isn’t good for anyone."

If all of these things come to pass, it’s likely the Democrats will lose on the typical number of seats for the “in-power” party, somewhere in the 10 - 20 range.If, however, we see the annual inflation rate continuing to run amok, if Russia fully invades Ukraine, if the Fed follows through with 6 (or more) rate hikes, if the administration doesn’t take visible steps to secure the southern border, and if the DA’s in places like California and New York continue to play softball with the criminals…….I believe we will likely see a landslide worse than the Democrats faced twelve years ago when they lost 63 seats.

Archives:  Are those missing documents ready yet?

Trump flunkey: Come and get them.


>Over the summer, the Archives reached out about high-profile documents that did not seem to be among those turned over, a person familiar with the matter said. Those included correspondence with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un that Trump once described as “love letters,” as well as a letter left for Trump by President Barack Obama, the person said. The National Archives also inquired about a map of Hurricane Dorian that had been altered with a black marker by Trump in a failed attempt to show he had not been wrong about the storm’s path, the person said.

The rest is not true if you trust ""people close to him"" (and the WaPo too, in these suspicious days).

Trump was very secretive about the packing of boxes that were retrieved from Mar-a-Lago last month, and did not let other aides — including some of his most senior advisers — look at them, according to people close to him."

So if my loan is $500 and I have $30 in interest but only pay $20, I now owe $510 - but only the original $500 is accruing interest.

Firstly, because they didn't agree to 2% yet. They agreed to raise spending to 2% by 2024. Plenty are on track to meet that target. It's unlikely they'll be reducing spending any time soon. Germany may fail to meet that target, but in 2014 they spent $30 billion on their military. In 2021 that number grew to over $50 billion. Sure, that may not be enough, but it's clear they are actually doing something about it. You can't just triple spending from one day to the next.

Secondly, the US spends just over 3% of GDP on the military. But that helps pay for a global presence. NATO is only a part of what the US military does, whereas that's not the case for many European NATO allies. You're comparing apples with oranges.

Lastly, direct US expenses on defence in Europe are estimated to range between $30-35 billion in 2018. That's roughly 5 - 6% of the total US budget. European NATO allies spent roughly $240 billion, and a lot of that money was spent buying US military tech and systems. I wouldn't be surprised that if you actually crunched the numbers, and included money made from weapons exports to European allies, the US actually makes a small profit off of NATO.

Of course, explaining this to voters takes time, and rational arguments rarely work against opinions based on emotion. Which is what the Russians and Chinese are counting on.

Resulting in idiots coming to the conclusion that the US is better off not being allied to NATO allies with a combined defense budget of a quarter of a trillion dollars, or having access to military bases and airports across the continent and globe."

While you're not entirely wrong, words have different definitions depending on the context they're used, Sin is almost exclusively used to depict an act of transgression against Divine Law, and is usually meant to mean a transgression against a God(s).

Divine Laws and Moral Laws are entirely different, even though Religion is mainly an early form of societal construct. It's hard for an Athiest to say he has sinned because, by his own belief, he does not accept the assertion of a God or the ""Divine"", ergo it would be a bizarre use of the word."

b. Tell and do: Legalize Marijuana, and expunge non Violent Pot offenses if we can get the House and Senate. 

c. Forgive $10,000 of Federal Student debt (I know a lot of you will want to down vote this because you want more, but I do not believe more than that will happen.), or set all Federal Student Loan debt interest  0.  

AND FORGIVE ANY DEBT OF ANY ACTIVE MEDICAL PERSONNEL. If anyone deserves it it is the fine Men and Women walking into that BURNING BUILDING every day. 

They will have to reform the entire industries of Universities and Loans because you can't just forgive people now and let the system keep running because the institutions will up their prices betting on another Government Payout to cancel their student loan debt.

This will be a HUGE financial hit for the US economy (Once again, before you down vote go 'do your research' about debt backed investments.  2008 happened because you use bankruptcy to get out of your house debt and that house of cards collapsed.  The Student Loan backed ones CANNOT be discharged by bankruptcy, only death (some get Public Student Loan Forgiveness, but they make it so hard and make a misplaced comma void your entire paperwork) so they are an attractive 'security' investment.)

If the Dems could just get all the House and Senate we could get some real stuff done and right this ship.  Using a few carrots on sticks like legalizing POT (I dont use it, but it SMELLS like everyone else does) and some form of Student Debt reform.

6985,"hy4b6ht",2,0,"/r/politics","You seem angry (and rightly so) so I will assume it with the situation and not with me personally.  So here's my response.

Yep, 17 is young and inexperienced.  But most of these kids have parents and other adults that are not 17 to advise them.  There is still some level of accountability to be born by the folks who take out a loan.  Otherwise we are setting up for failure in a different way.

Regarding the banks comparison, yes i know.  I am not comparing the current folks with student loans to banks in 2008 from a knowledge or ethics pov.  Just the concept of setting up a moral hazard in general.  For the long term, we can't set up a situation of excusing student loan debt with no system or parameters in place.  If people know they can fall back on ""well I was 17"" as the reason, it's just gonna cause some of the same young inexperienced people to take out large loans against private colleges and universities for exorbitant amounts.

""And so you're not okay with forgiveness, but you're okay with forgiveness after X amount of time?""
Yes I am.  If your income is above a certain level you should be able to make an effort to repay at a reasonable level (5% of income?) for at least some period of time.  If your income is below some threshold, you don't pay.

Yes very true about the political prospects of ever getting a real solution in place.  But that should not dissuade a conversation about what a reasonable system would look like.

Forgiveness of loans is a start yes but what about my other points?  The money is not free.  50% of folks never go to college.  Are we asking them to help foot that bill?  Who pays for the forgiven loans?  Maybe there is some other funding mechanism to handle that funding.  Increase taxes in higher brackets.  One time tax charge or something.

Do we forgive debt for technical and trade schools as well?  What about for folks who took out loans to attend shady for-profit institutions that any reasonable adult should be able to tell is a bad deal?

As I was trying to convey in my last paragraph in the op, the press is often doing a lousy job reporting on this issue.  Obviously something's gotta give.  But developing a consensus around a better system for the future starts with reporting on other better options, interviewing folks with ideas about what that might look like, etc.  But instead the press mostly wants to focus on the most emotional political back and forth that gets clicks."

7001,"hy0y38y",2,0,"/r/politics","What the fuck are you talking about with 3000/month.  Its a fucking loan.  Of course it will grow.  Are you arguing that ANY interest on loans is unfair? Even if you think interest is unfair/predatory, no one is REQUIRED to pay 3k/mo on a 40k loan.  Its not even worth using that as a case for why forgiveness is necessary.
 
40k loan @ 9% is a payment of 507/mo over 10 years. If you pay 3k/mo then it's paid off in a year.  

I paid 35k off in a year and a half making 40k/yr.  Like I said, I didn't pay rent for that year and a half, but even if I did, it would only have delayed my paying it off by a couple of years.

You know what people should do about the 60 senator issue?  Get out and vote.  I voted for Bernie and donated to him every month.  When he didn't win the primary, I supported Biden.  I went out and voted, because I'm an adult and Trump is/was horrible.  Millenials/younger voters outnumber the Boomers, but our turnout is fucking garbage.  Our age cohort must not care all that much about the issues if they dont even show up.

They didn't do anything in school because their parents didn't graduate high school but had nice homes and a comfortable life. You used to be able to do that in America. They never wanted for anything growing up. They were never required to do anything on their own merit, other than playing sports. They still at nearly 50 years old talk about going to get money from their parents. One of them even brags about everything he does for what he has, but only has money because his grandparents used to own a huge farm that his parents sold for a substantial sum.

We know Republicans are a party of criminality and abuse top to bottom. No one should ever vote for a Republican.

  


Democrats told us they were different, and once they got into office they proved that they would conveniently hide behind scapegoats, finger pointing, and blatant lies because the people at the top of leadership are complicit enablers.

  


3 weeks ago, Joe Biden called Mitch McConnell his good friend and an honorable man. This is the kind of person we are dealing with. Democrats at the top who consider the most evil, corrupt, harmful, murderous, obstructionist Republicans who have done more harm to America than we can even describe, they consider them their friends, and honorable people.

I certainly won't deny that unregulated prostitution is riddled with abuse (pimps are notorious psychopaths), something I think can be largely solved by legalizing and regulating prostitution. But we punish the victims (I know Johns are also punished here, but it's pretty fucked we punish the women at all). 

I read a few years ago that in Scandinavia, it's illegal to be a john, but not to be a hooker. That is very fair imo

EDIT: sorry a comment below reminded me to specify, they have legal prostitution that's regulated and it's assured that all parties are consensual, safe, 18+, etc. It's only illegal to pay for the services of an underground prostitute, who's very likely trafficked/coerced/underaged/etc"

Well, the owners and the stadium would fail if there were no customers. The customers are contributing to the new stadium by buying their products and services, which come at a premium etc.. Their role in the equation shouldn't also be to fund the cost to build. Unless they are getting some sort of revenue sharing.

* The KGB is paying them in money
* or in oppo research on Dem candidates
* or, by offering to invest in factories and other infrastructure in the states and House districts. (I'm looking at you, Mitch McConnell.)

Notice that Republicans who cannot be blackmailed, like Liz Cheney, are immune to the KGB threats. Some might fall to KGB money, but then after that they can be blackmailed."

> For a few years now, the leaders of the Republican Party have pretty steadfastly avoided outlining anything amounting to an actual party agenda. The 2020 Republican platform was merely a (somewhat awkward) repeat of its 2016 document, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has pointedly declined to state in advance what he would do with a Senate majority after the 2022 election. “I’ll let you know when we take it back,” McConnell has said.
> 
> The posture certainly reinforces that the GOP has come to be defined more by one man (Donald Trump) and his accompanying political ethos than by a consistent set of ideals. But it also serves a rather evident purpose: to avoid pinning the party down on specifics that might become liabilities at some point — particularly as its principles have shifted markedly in recent years.
> 
> All of which Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) has now reinforced.
> 
> Scott, the head of Senate Republicans’ campaign arm, has responded to McConnell’s lack of an agenda with an agenda of his own. While stressing that it’s his own product and not affiliated with the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Scott is a GOP leader and a potential future presidential candidate. Thus, it carries some weight.
> 
> And while many have focused on what the agenda says about culture-war issues such as transgender rights, one of the most striking and evocative parts is what it says about taxes. The 11-point plan calls for new taxes on tens of millions of Americans, by rekindling the same issue that led Mitt Romney to stumble into his “47 percent” gaffe.
> 
> “All Americans should pay some income tax to have skin in the game, even if a small amount,” the plan says. “Currently over half of Americans pay no income tax.”
> 
> The language of the plan itself effectively acknowledges it’s advocating for an income tax increase on “over half of Americans” — a group of people that is overwhelmingly lower-income. And in fact, the number of Americans to whom this would apply has climbed during the pandemic.
> 
> While Romney overly simplistically referred to 47 percent of people who both paid no income tax and voted for Democrats because of it, the number who paid no income tax was indeed around half. In 2020, though, that number climbed as high as 61 percent, according to the Tax Foundation.
> 
> You begin to see the potential political problem here. Scott’s document doesn’t discuss the issue in as ham-handed a way as Romney did in that infamous video — though suggesting those who don’t pay income taxes don’t have “skin in the game” is certainly dicey. But it does advocate for raising taxes on, in the Tax Foundation’s estimate, as many as 75 million people who paid no such taxes after deductions and credits in 2020. If you include the 32 million who didn’t file returns, such as retirees, the number climbs well over 100 million Americans. (Scott’s plan isn’t explicit on whether his idea would include such people, but it does say “all Americans.”)
> 
> The political ads almost write themselves: The leader of the effort to elect a Senate majority wants to use that to raise taxes on as much as half of the country, however modestly. The GOP has for years defined virtually any new tax as a tax increase, and this meets that definition.
> 
> The move is also particularly interesting because it’s far out of step with how at least one prominent Republican tackled this issue during the Trump era. As NBC’s Benjy Sarlin wrote a year ago, Trump effectively said people not having to pay income taxes was something to be celebrated. He proposed codifying a zero percent income tax rate for those making $25,000 per year individually or $50,000 as a married couple — rather than those people merely getting to zero through deductions. He even floated sending those people tax returns that stated, “I win.” Trump proudly projected his plan would increase the number of Americans who didn’t pay income tax to 75 million.
> 
> Precisely why this was included in Scott’s agenda is an interesting question — both given how it contrasts with Trump’s tax vision and because of the headaches it could cause the party. For now, though, much like Romney’s 47 percent comment, it’s going to force some measure of accounting. That would start, it would seem, with McConnell and the candidates whose election to the Senate Scott is in charge of leading.
> 
> At the very least, it would seem a good opportunity to start talking about what the GOP would actually do with that Senate majority.

Raise Taxes on 75-100 Million Americans. What Master Politicians.

Lastly, in those areas of Donetsk and Luhansk which could be polled after the Russian-backed separatists launched their war (so those areas not then under rebel control), an absolute majority were opposed to unification with Russia, and a supermajority were either opposed or undecided.  Obviously there have been referrendums held in the occupied territories which have different results, with questions raised about their accuracy, so it is impossible to have a clear picture.  Additionally, some raion in those oblasts (outside of the occupied areas) have held referrendum which showed support to have their raion moved to one of the neighboring oblasts. So at the very least it calls into question whether the entirety of these two oblasts want independence.

Your comparison to Kosovo or South Korea fall flat, because in those territories, the will of the people was clear.  That is certainly not the case in the Donbass.

Trump, who will pay a lawyer ten times what he owes a contractor just to get out of the contract, has exploited chickenshittery in prosecutors his whole life. He is clearly hoping it will save his neck post-coup. 

>But New York's attorney general, Letitia James, has not shared Garland's timidity in the face of Trump's relentless threats of lawsuits and counter-filings. Instead, she's gone hard after Trump and his family, based on the extensive evidence of decades of fraud. So far, her willingness to put up a fight has garnered significant returns. Trump's accounting firm fired him, a sign they see his company as a ship they'd rather not go down with. And last week, a Manhattan judge ruled that Trump and his children must sit for depositions, after a ridiculous hearing in which Trump's lawyers spewed conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton in a pathetic bid to confuse the issue at hand. 

>And despite a lack of support from the DOJ, the January 6 committee has been doing a good job of accruing evidence that Trump's coup was extensive and organized. Plenty of what has been leaked indicates criminal activity Trump could be easily be arrested for either pressuring Georgia's secretary of state into fabricating votes, destroying evidence, or absconding with classified materials. The National Archives has now joined with the January 6 committee into unsubtly and publicly nudging a reluctant DOJ into doing something about this criminal who will absolutely attempt another coup if he's not stopped. And in standing up to Trump, both the National Archives and the January 6 committee show that sometimes victory is possible — but only if you actually fight. 

>Maybe the fantasies of so many on Twitter will manifest and the cuffs will suddenly come out for Trump. Likelier, however, is what Brian Beutler of Crooked Media recently wrote of Garland in his newsletter: ""[W]e'd be naive not to wonder how much of his reluctance to enforce the law against prominent right-wing criminals is driven by fear"" of a right-wing backlash. The problem, however, is that ""if crooks can opt out of the criminal law through public intimidation, we should wonder how much they'll ultimately get away with simply by threatening to whip up a public shitstorm if they meet any resistance."""

I think when the elite and regular white male population get conflated, it triggers the average White guy. Are there some racists who think that Jews and other minorities are trying to oppress them, of course.. but at the same time there is certainly an anti-white sentiment amongst some that goes largely unchecked which is amplified on the internet causing a “panic” amongst some. Shit, I’m from Hawaii and we had “kill haole” day at school. It’s pretty tame these days but it used to be down right brutal and some thought they were justified for one reason or another because whites as a race “deserved it”. 

One must also remember when your average white guy from a working/middle class background grows up, does what he’s supposed to, works hard and ends up fairly successful, he doesn’t think to himself “man it’s good to be white!”. For him it just affirms his belief that doing the right thing pays off. So if he’s constantly bombarded about “whiteness” and “white privilege” it’s an abstract and often insulting concept to him. What was he supposed to do? He was born white, and did what he was told and it worked out for him. Then when you have white communities that haven’t had shit for generations it’s kinda like “what privilege to have that’s tangible?” 

I think a more dangerous fantasy is thinking that most people give that much shit about race. I’m not saying there aren’t racial issues, but by and large people just don’t think like that. The vast majority of people I’ve met around the world have been decent people. Identify politics is a cancer, just as class politics are. The only thing that should be pitted against each other are ideas, not people. Any idea needs to be applicable to all. Wanna solve poverty? Great, solve it in the inner cities and Appalachia.

* Universities say ""Students can get loans - they can afford more tuition, and we need to expand faculty/staff/facilities, so we're raising tuition.""
* State governments say ""Students can get loans, so we can stop subsidizing state school tuition with state taxes - they can raise tuition.""
* People who sell stuff to students (housing, restaurants, etc...) say ""Students have loans - they can afford nicer stuff, so we can raise prices, build more expensive housing and restaurants, etc...""

Cancel student debt, but make sure we don't continue to enable the mess above:

* Federal government is on the hook for most of the $$, but has to stop loaning $$ to people who can't possibly repay it.  Give grants to low-income people who actually need it, but no more money fountain.
* Universities need to unwind tuition increases - they'll have to if there is no more student loan money fountain.

Obama got that from the start, and he did very well in his elections; the off-years, on the other hand, were a disaster because what works in the general election will not work in an off-year as long as the Democrats keep on browbeating the independent voters. 

So, for example, telling voters they have to love the cultural issues, or they won't get that new tax cut or school or actual issue they really care about will never work.

The Democrats are the only functioning party. People will vote for Democrats because there are only two choices; one is willing to support Trump, so the other has to be better... and then the Democrats parade their circus into town, and the independent voters bemused or frighten at the spectacle of it all, sit it out.

Thankfully it didn't totally work because the party's reputation was too damaged (in the western half of the country at least), but it's a horrifyingly effective strategy."

Putin needs to be in a position where backing off or conceding defeat is more favourable to him than pushing through with any available alternative until somebody else stops him. A lot of wars like this start with the instigator cornered in a situation where they have the face the music either way, and one option taking down more people with them than the other isn't at all a discouragement.

It's pointless for anyone else to ponder the consequences of any given option when they don't know the alternatives of the people deciding on it. If there isn't one, then they'll take their only option and the consequences of it in a vacuum are irrelevant; the person that chose it will say they had no choice for an alternative."

prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against a person or people on the basis of their membership in a particular racial or ethnic group, typically one that is a minority or marginalized.

> But hey, wipe the debt because it’s someone elses problem I made a bad choice.

I think this is the main motivation factor. Some personal responsibility has to come in to play for this, you should be doing your research on colleges, cost, and what path you should take.

He has levied proportional sanctions against Russia that allows us to maintain the leverage of ratcheting up sanctions further.

He’s crushing it on this crisis. He deserves praise"
10199,"hy2bcww",2,0,"/r/politics","So, if the defense is going to be that he didn't take classified documents away from the White House because he has the ability to declassify the documents, then that means those documents are declassified now and we can see them, right?"
10200,"hxzx038",2,0,"/r/politics","Actually these federal student loans are the reason tuition is so high, the schools know that even if the student goes bankrupt they will still get paid. In this scenario there is not a whole lot of motivation to provide reasonable tuition rates."

Think of it like this: You want to go into IT, but can't afford the training. So you apply for an IT job as a low-income individual. After you are accepted into the federal program, the government will pay for your IT training, and then you'll work in IT for the government for 6 years.
