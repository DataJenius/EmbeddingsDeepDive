Trump was so hated by the elite establishment that the significant participants of said establishment stopped blending in to openly attack him. Without Trump we wouldn't have known how shady tech companies were, whether it's PayPal, social media's, Google, gofundme. We wouldn't have payed as much attention to media bias or intentional disinformation in articles only to be edited after the damage was done. If Hillary won the election the courts would be stacked blue, the media would have carried her through 2 terms and the democrat's destruction would have been a much slower process allowing them to squeeze by bad policy after bad policy and still keep a majority of americans voting for them because they are constantly assured the dems have ""good intentions"". It would have been the end of the Republican party and the beginning of totalitarian government radicalizing children in schools and no one would have known. Covid would have come and gone and the deaths would be reported as ""unavoidable"" and ""Hillary did the best she could"". They would have a lot of uninformed voters blindly doing what they're told and because they hated Trump so much they put too much spotlight on him people like me and millions of others became interested in politics and started questioning things. Regardless of policy or personal opinions of the guy, he inadvertently did more for the future of the country than any other Republican president IMO by simply letting these power-hungry elites roar their ugly heads.

"10",10,"hy3gow6",3,1,"/r/Conservative","The whole point of NATO expansion is extending the US defense commitment and nuclear umbrella to foreign nations.

After the fall of the Berlin Wall, NATO expanded eastward, incorporating Poland and the Baltic States which were huge wins for the US and Western European powers, especially Germany, because the zone of conflict moved out of their territory.

It's naive to think further expansion of NATO into Ukraine would enhance security for the US or Europe.

Biden should negotiate with the Russians, which was the point of that Minsk accords which the US never took seriously.  The old deal proposed by Russia was to provide some level of autonomy to the Donbass regions while keeping Ukraine free of foreign troops.

The US never engaged in that bargaining because the deep state types thought they could make Ukraine NATO membership a done deal by increments.

Now, Putin has taken that off the table.  Ukraine is now a state with active military dispute inside its official borders.  They *can't* get into NATO now because that would automatically trigger Article 5 of collective defense.

But the Biden administration will not engage in this realpolitik approach.  They will bluster about and issue sanctions etc.  But it's all just noise, while the Russians will get what they were after which is preventing Ukraine from joining NATO.

In terms of OP question, it's laughable to think any American president can make an argument for military intervention with Congress or the American public to protect Ukraine's territorial integrity."

The willingness of Canadians to seemingly happily grant this sort of power to a central authority, for a non-emergency, is terrifying to those of us with an already low degree of trust in federal government in the US. It's too close to home not just in proximity, but in values.

Think about the fact that a group of peaceful protestors, exercising their right to protest (can argue about blocking roadways for sure), entirely peaceful, was demonized as some evil white supremecist, Nazi movement.  They were protesting government tyranny and then put down by some questionably exercised emergency powers (aka ramped up government tyranny).

I want to offer you my sympathies; I know how hard it is to watch someone waste away under hospice. I'm going to try to temper my response, because I know that this sort of thing messes with your cognition, and you aren't thinking clearly with relation to that.

People dying, even by the thousands each year, is not a reason to restrict the rights and freedoms of 330,000,000 people (just in the continental USA alone). More people die of obesity-related, smoking-related, alcohol-related, and car-related causes (heart attacks, stroke, lung cancer, cirrhosis, car accidents, etc.) per year then have died during the entire covid ""pandemic"". You never hear people argue that we must restrict all access and rights to unhealthy food, alcohol, legal smoking products (which is on an UPWARD TREND for fucks sake because of all the marijuana addicts clamoring to be legalized), cars, etc. due to these deaths.

And make no mistake, each and every one of those deaths is a ""personal choice"" death, not a ""lightning from a blue sky"" deaths.

Covid restrictions and mandates make no sense, except when viewed through an economic lens for the massive profits made for Pfizer and Moderna in the last two years (the latter of which, curiously, had literally never had a successful product until their covid ""vaccine"" was pre-purchased by the hundreds of millions by governments using our tax dollars)."

If Germany becomes truly dependent on Russia for gas, they will have no choice but to start favoring Russian policies and stances in all political theatres. NATO, the UN etc. If there is ever a policy or proposal which would seriously hurt Russia, they can threaten to cut the gas. Maybe in the long term Germany will be fine, but in the short term those cuts will hurt and German politicians may have no choice politically but to give in. Adding another pipeline allows Germany to become more dependent on Russian gas, so the US wants to prevent that.

From the US perspective, even if they don't technically have a moral right to interfere, they do have an very obvious interest in interfering anyway. Although, it would be a whole lot more effective if the US provided an alternative solution to Russian gas, maybe selling its own gas to Germany at lower costs. Whatever happens, Germany needs energy, blocking the pipeline but not offering an alternative will only delay the inevitable. But if their trying to buy time to get a deal in place to solve Germany's energy issues while keeping them independent of Russian gas, then blocking it right now makes sense.

Also, here's what the literal founder of facism and other facists in Europe considered it to be.   


""Mussolini established the first fascist regime, followed soon after by others, including Nazi Germany. Fascism, however, differed somewhat from one nation to another. Thus, scholars often disagree on a precise definition of fascism. Even so, they tend to agree on its common characteristics such as:
  


* Absolute Power of the State: Fascist regimes have a strong centralized state, or national government. The fascist state seeks total control over all major parts of society. Individuals must give up their private needs and rights to serve the needs of the whole society as represented by the state.
  

* Rule by a Dictator: A single dictator runs the fascist state and makes all the important decisions. This leader often uses charisma, a magnetic personality, to gain the support of the people.
  

* Corporatism: Fascists believe in taming capitalism by controlling labor and factory owners. Unions, strikes, and other labor actions are illegal. Although private property remains, the state controls the economy.
  

* Extreme Nationalism: The fascist state uses national glory and the fear of outside threats to build a new society based on the ‚Äúcommon will‚Äù of the people. Fascists believe in action and looking at national myths for guidance rather than relying on the ‚Äúbarren intellectualism‚Äù of science and reason.
  

* Superiority of the Nation‚Äôs People: Fascists hold up the nation‚Äôs people as superior to other nationalities. They typically strengthen and unify the dominant group in a nation while stifling dissent and persecuting minority groups.
  

* Militarism and Imperialism: Fascists believe that great nations show their greatness by conquering and ruling weak nations. Fascists believe the state can survive only if it successfully proves its military superiority in war.""

Even then Trump only ticks 2 of them at most and that's a stretch and a half.

If you both agree that neither socialism or capitalism have not been properly implemented, then (historically speaking) trying to figure out how a socialist system would work would be more likely to end up badly than a capitalistic society. You can say Stalin's Russia wasn't true communism, but the fact is that what has historically happened is that the Trotskys and the Lennins get ousted and the Stalins take over, because the Stalins are the ones who will do anything to get power in any political structure, be it socialist or capitalist. You have to fix that if you want socialism to work

I'm a democratic socialist but still can admit that every attempt at true socialism or communism has resulted in worse outcomes for the average citizen than even the United States' current capitalistic structure. The American standard of living is still head and shoulders above 90-95% of other countries and trying to say that capitalism has resulted is Americans being worse off than they would have been without capitalism is an unwinnable argument. If you actually want to bring people over to our side you have to admit that our plan for how a socialist government would work is extremely flawed in the real world because of the amount of bad actors who want power, and we have to completely rethink how it should be implemented. It's not useful to come in here and just scream ""socialism is better reeeeeeeee,"" you're actually making it harder for the rest of us by being such a belligerent asshat

Socialism doesn't automatically get rid of bad people taking advantage of the system, it just changes the landscape and concentrates power. When you concentrate power that much and those people finally crack the code, it becomes insanely easy for a Stalin or a Pinochet or a Kim to quickly manipulate their way into being a Supreme leader.

(hint: we shall)

""The laws that forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature. They disarm only those who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes.... Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.""
- Thomas Jefferson, Commonplace Book (quoting 18th century criminologist Cesare Beccaria), 1774-1776

""A strong body makes the mind strong. As to the species of exercises, I advise the gun. While this gives moderate exercise to the body, it gives boldness, enterprise and independence to the mind. Games played with the ball, and others of that nature, are too violent for the body and stamp no character on the mind. Let your gun therefore be your constant companion of your walks."" - Thomas Jefferson, letter to Peter Carr, August 19, 1785

""The Constitution of most of our states (and of the United States) assert that all power is inherent in the people; that they may exercise it by themselves; that it is their right and duty to be at all times armed.""
- Thomas Jefferson, letter to to John Cartwright, 5 June 1824

""The supposed quietude of a good man allures the ruffian; while on the other hand, arms, like law, discourage and keep the invader and the plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property. The balance ofpower is the scale of peace. The same balance would be preserved were all the world destitute of arms, for all would be alike; but since some will not, others dare not lay them aside. And while a single nation refuses to lay them down, it is proper that all should keep them up. Horrid mischief would ensue were one-half the world deprived of the use of them; for while avarice and ambition have a place in the heart of man, the weak will become a prey to the strong. The history of every age and nation establishes these truths, and facts need but little arguments when they prove themselves.""

Back to race though, just about every lingering social problem that black people face specifically in the US is a result of decades of Democrat policies and left-wing ideology being spread in academia, in the media, and in pop culture. Any law, policy, or economic development that actually improves the condition of black people in the US long-term is vehemently opposed by Democrats. 

Before the pandemic, Trump's policies resulted in record low unemployment in every single racial group in the US, energy independence for the US, rabid wage growth, and a huge surge in entrepreneurial success in black communities. This was the result of tax cuts and loosening regulations. The entire opposition that Trump faced by Democrats revolves around their fear of the fact that his policies would give minorities in the US a taste of economic success that didn't depend on Democrat-implemented government handouts."

Biden slapped on a bunch of sanctions on Russia this morning. Basically he banned two banks and a bunch of oligarchs from trading in the US and Europe, shut down nord stream 2 and said US and Europe will not give them any new finance. In essence he did a light version of what Trudeau is doing to the truckers in Canada. Oh and despite these sanctions Europe and the US will still continue to buy gas and oil from Russia.


  
To be honest these sanctions are a joke. First all these people would have moved their funds a long time ago in preparation for this. Second if you cannot get China on board the sanctions have no weight. So they cannot trade in Europe and US. They just go to the Hong Kong stock exchange. Need to borrow funds? Just do what the US and Europe do. Go borrow from China.

 
  
Its not the 1990‚Äôs where the US and allies had a complete monopoly on finances. Russia can easily bypass any sanctions and a weak and impotent Biden will not have the resolve to force China‚Äôs hand. Russia and China are laughing at him. 


  
And as a final point, this would not have happened under Trump. Most people know this but the left will never admit it. Why this would have never happened under Trump is because his sanctions would actually hurt Russia. He made the US energy independent and a net exporter. He was dead set against nord stream 2 and the reliance US and Europe had on Russia for oil and gas. He would have crippled Russia into submission by taking Europe‚Äôs dependence on them and starving their oil and gas industries. Instead a weak Biden who shut down Keystone is dependent on the very country he is sanctioning."

Sure the majority of people in these areas are Russian. Do you know why that is? Because the Russian military armed and fought with a group of Russian separatists that took over the territory‚Äôs in 2014 and began pushing out all of the Ukrainians. Prior to that ethnic Ukrainians were the majority of the people there and the ethnic Russians were a sizeable minority. If we start pushing our people into Mexico and then shoving out all of the Mexicans does that mean that territory becomes part of the United States? It‚Äôs essentially just a slower moving invasion. 

Also does it not tip you off at all that all of this started because Ukraine wanted to join nato and Russia didn‚Äôt want them too? Yet now all of a sudden we are talking about whether Russian people were being wronged and if Ukraine rightfully belongs to Russia. Weird how at the same moment Russia was upset about something they also remembered that suddenly care about these people in another country. 

Also does it not give you pause at all to know that this is the third and 4th invasion by Russia since 2008?

Things that have contributed to our decline.   
1. The inability to actually purchase commercial property. We get out bid by equity groups, then have to deal with leasing from them. They get greedy on the lease and there is not much we can do about it. So we just have to fork over the cash. It's literally a you either lease from them or you don't own a business. Commercial property never comes up for sale and when it does it's dozens of equity groups outbidding actual business owners who want to actually use it. One of the locations we have, we have been there 20 years. Building probably cost the Land Lord maybe $500-700k to build. We've shelled out well over $1.4 Million over 20 years on the lease and cam. Lease and cam today are running north of $50k a year. It's ridiculous, the worst part? The landlord inherited it from her father about 8 years ago. She's been special to say the least. We would have loved to have purchased it, but never get/have the opportunity. I tried to buy a location up the street and bid more 15% above market. Some equity group outbid us. Then they tried to lease us the building.. It's such a racket/scam.   
2. Health insurance premiums, they are insane.. $58k a year to insure 7 people.   
3. Disappearing middle class, the small business owners were my bread and butter. They'd make any place from $250-300k a year maybe more. They'd have no issue dropping $6500-12k a year with us. I've watched them all get taken out by Amazon, Google, Walmart and the like.   
4. Big businesses getting into our industry. They have all the advantages on earth. They can self insure, they have their own legal teams, they can get products cheaper.. They cut the middle man out.. it all leads to them being able to offer a price point I simply can not match.  
5. Litigation is another big one. It's a constant threat and I constantly spend a fortune trying to avoid it.

> Oil production has very little to do with the president. 

This is false.  In 'tha biz'.  While I'm no 'expert', I'll give you some insight...

While it's true that Biden doesn't directly 'control' prices, the effect that his (& largely Democrat, et al) political policies, ideologies, and words definitely can't be understated. It VERY much drives sentiment and investment. The pricing slump of '20 was absolutely devastating to production / tool / associated companies. Not just due to lack of demand, but a supply glut previously unparalleled, largely thanks to a Russia / Saud & UAE pricing war. Not just resulting in a massive production cut, but I've seen numbers in the 270's estimating bankruptcies in the sector during '20/'21. When you have a president that ran on political policies pushing for 'green' this & that, dumping executive orders to that effect left & right, being basically a rubber stamp for anything 'green' that congress squeaks by, ICE cars announced to cease production (thanks to government penalties) across multiple major auto manufacturers, record investments into EV auto's, the investment money and willingness to re-enter that market dry up pretty quick from all but the most die hard or brave. You've also got to remember, a LOT of those investors are actual boomers, probably past retirement age at this point, or at least looking for that final exit.  Good luck getting any younger investors.  Hell, even I'm reluctant (middle aged) to put much of my portfolio in any related companies. A lot of this is anecdotal from first hand experience, but while there is a slow rise in activity, the 'rubber banding' in production that generally coincides with decreasing supply & rising prices seems much slower and way more muted than previous 'comeback's'. Tag on ~15% inflation, slowly increasing demand, an international incident... and it doesn't take a genius.

I mean, ""yay team green!"" & whatever... but it's gonna hurt for a while if you're still pumping gas. It's gonna hurt bad, and Biden seems to be fresh out of Novocaine.

First issue is that the cross-border mandate that wasn't a thing for almost 2 years, was conceived and the Liberals nor  Canada's 'top doctor' could justify the new requirement when asked.

Second issue is that the truckers announced they were coming and why they were coming weeks ahead of leaving.  Trudeau did nothing.

Then the truckers arrived - Trudeau does nothing.

Then weeks go by - Trudeau does nothing (other than call them every ' -ist' in the Liberal world salad playbook).

Of course it will never be examined this way, but the Liberals have just as large of a hand in causing this as the truckers themselves.  Throw in the corrupt media, and it makes sense why many fellow Canadians are brainwashed into thinking the Emergencies Act is a good thing.

There still isn't talk around how the cross-border mandate is for safety, what data justified the mandate, and when it'll be cancelled.

Then in my senior year I had to drive a 78 suburban with a big block 396, 8 MPG, but it did 8mpg no matter what you did to it. 40 gallon tank, so about $70 to fill up, but I could go anywhere, and with the money I was making working in a warehouse throwing dog food around, I could easily afford it.

Now, with fuel edging up to $4 again... I'm considering converting one of my cars to EFI, to get the fuel economy as high as possible. Some would say ""just buy a new car!""

Don't even get me started on how much better it looks, then you have insurance costs, maintenance, tags are cheaper, too. $7.50 yearly inspection, opposed to the $70-something on top of taxes (Texas prices).

Not that it matters, but I'm vaxxed (was forced due to employment), but I could give two shits about what anyone else does.  I don't walk around worrying about what everyone else is doing.

As you described it, i feel their mentality is irrational forced compliance.  How the hell did we get here.  They leave no openness to natural immunity for one.  Taking that stance also makes no sense in the context of obese people and hard-core smokers and drinkers which are a 'tax' on the healthcare system as well. Are they proposing they shouldn't qualify for medical care? 

And guess what- say anything like this to them and immediately they pull what they think is moral superiority (which is misplaced) and say you hate science, you don't care about anyone around you, and you're every '-ist' in their word salad playbook.  Having a conversation is impossible with them.  And say anything remote like this on an average sub, and in about 3 minutes you'll be banned.  I know this from experience.

I'm not  sure the left even knows what 'progressive' even means.  I personally hate the word.  All progressive means is change.  Not always, in fact quite frequently, change isn't good.  So I always wonder what's utopia for them.  They want change- ok for what, and how much change is 'needed', and who determines that the change is good or complete or successful?

Clearly not asking you to answer, this is all rhetorical. 

When Andrew Scheer ran for the conservatives, then later with Erin O'Tool, each said that the abortion (as an example) debate won't be opened.  But the media never let the questioning die and threw Trudeau softballs constantly.  Trudeau even sued to keep certain journalists and media outlets away from being able to ask him questions.

All so frustrating.

What Democrats have learned is they can push their political wet dreams every time they get power and it makes little difference on the shift in power. 

Obama came into office with a super majority. Democrats pushed Financial reform for a problem they created that no one asked for. They pushed climate change which wasn't even a top 10 issue for Americans. And they pushed healthcare reform which wasn't even a top 20 issue for Americans.

All of them far left stances and not even a decade later they regained control of Congress and then the presidency. So called moderates just shifted left with them as it became the new ""normal"".

But to make your stance even worse. Even with a popular Reaganesque president, the Pendulum *still swings*. Reagan was hampered by having a fully Democrat House and Senate for 6 of his 8 years in office. Meaning that if Republicans wait to tackle the issue they will *never* tackle the issue.

This applies to conservative issues across the board, not just abortion. If Republicans are not willing to implement real and meaningful reforms while in power they have squandered their capacity to do so. It's less a conservative party (American sense of word, not European) and more a status quo Party. As in no one can ever expect Republicans to do anything."

Nor would I, as in both situations, it's the free market at work.    For the increase of oil imports to be a bad thing, you'd have to be able to point to a drop in domestic oil production which we are unable to do.

3. When you go out in public, you accept the risks that come with it. If you are afraid of getting infected when going outside, why should I have to get a vaccination that **wouldn't prevent you from getting the virus from me to begin with**?

Seriously, I don't get the logic here. I can infect you either way, regardless of how vaccinated I am. Maybe the symptoms would be less severe for me, so there's less risk for you because I'm not coughing everywhere...but you still can get it from any person. That being said, why do you even care whether someone gets the vaccine or not? It doesn't affect you!

Now it's my turn for a question...knowing you can get it from me if I'm vaccinated...knowing that you accept risks from going in public...what gives you the damn right to get me injected with something against my will, especially considering you aren't going to pay (or the pharma companies...or the government...) for it if I have a heart attack?

They showed people AT NIGHT in the US remotely celebrating the US athletes and their performances which comes across as fake and manufactured as well. Couldn't even bother to show the performance and the family at the same time, which would really have brought some heart to the programming that times like these *especially* call for when you have no real crowd to speak of. 

Finally, you had athletes that either decided they were going to represent China despite using US resources to train, like skater bitch from CA (don't know her name because she did miserably) or Eileen Gu, athletes like Shawn White and Mikaela Shiffrin fail to medal, or ongoing drama with ROC allowing doped athletes to perform in the Olympics and the IOC's limp-dick policy of allowing them to compete even after their doping has already been discovered, including the drama that ensued afterwards with a women's award ceremony in singles skating being in real jeopardy.

There really isn't such a thing. It's just that out of all practical attempts throughout history, capitalism has unarguably achieved a better existence for the average person. You have to be practical in your application of criticism towards existing ideologies. You're comparing real world examples, which are incapable of being perfect, to an ideal in your head about how something should be. You want me to name successful implementations of one ideology but can you even define what that would look like? I assume that any example I provide you'd immediately be able to find some arbitrary wrong that was committed that you'd somehow tout as proof of its failure.

It is not in this case. We shouldn't do anything about Russia. 

Our justification for our own annexation of Hawaii and Texas was that the American settlers there, who initially were expats living in foreign countries, eventually became a majority and wanted to join the united states. America supports self determination. This justification let us annex these regions, and rightfully so. Land doesn't belong to an ethnic group but rather to the actual people who actually live on a piece of land...

The eastern parts of Ukraine are mostly Russians who want Putin. Despite unsubstantiated claims the referenda in Crimea we're rigged, one cannot deny the outright celebrations upon their takeover by Russia. We have ample video evidence the crimeans wanted that.

Our own experiences with Afghanistan should teach us that if a population actually didn't want occupation, they will use guerilla tactics to keep out a foreign aggressor for an interminable amount of time. Where are the freedom fighters in Crimea? Hint... There are none. They want to be part of Russia. That is their right.

The bottom line is countries want to do business with Russia. They **want** cheap Russian gas.  If they wanted to reduce Russian gas consumption, they would have done so. They don't care about Ukraine. Germany may not certify Nordstream 2 now, but that's because the winter is nearly over, and they get gas in any case through Nordstream 1. If next winter is cold, they will quietly turn on Nordstream 2 as well.

US sanctions cause pain to other countries, because the US controls a lot of the financial systems (in particular SWIFT).

(for background https://fee.org/articles/swift-and-the-weaponization-of-the-us-dollar/ )


Countries do not like pain. They use systems that the US has control over because they are convenient. At some point they will switch over to systems that the US has no control over. They are already looking. This just increases the incentives to switch.

At the end of the day, a large part of US prosperity is because the rest of the world uses the dollar system to trade. If the rest of the world decides that it is no longer worth using US systems for trade, the US will suffer greatly."

We vote for MP's to represent us, every single MP sitting in Parliament right now got more votes than their rival.

Keep in mind we have 2 major left parties, the Liberal and NDP so the left vote is often split between them reducing their margin of victory across the country.


So as a simple example.  Say we have 3 ridings with 1000 voters in each.  In riding A the Conservative candidate wins  with 700 votes and the Liberal candidate only got 50.  In riding B The Liberal candidate wins with 550 votes and the Conservative got 400.  In riding C the Liberal wins again with 600 and the Conservative gets 350.

So we have 2 Liberal seats won and 1 Conservative but the Conservatives in total got 1450 votes and the Liberals only got 1200.  But everyone won the popular vote, and everyone's vote counted the same.  It's not a perfect system by any means, but how else do you do it?

"2243",2243,"hxv12h8",2,1,"/r/Conservative","I enjoyed it, but they completely destroyed the thought experiment Heinlein was engaged in.  Heinlein was musing as to whether or not citizenship should come at a price, whether or not true citizenship should require you make some kind of investment into the community as a whole.  It was a means to prevent ungrateful masses to simply vote from the government's coffers into their own bank accounts.  To become a citizen, you had to have some skin in the game.  In the book, a common way to ""give"" to the community and earn citizenship was to serve in the military (although it was not the ONLY means).  The leftist filmmakers simplified this to an easy, ""Government fascist, would you like to know more?""  

It is important to note that Heinlein didn't require you to necessarily provide something of substance (like military service) for citizenship, rather you just had to demonstrate a willingness to work towards the good of your society as a whole.  Like I said, it was an interesting thought experiment which could make for great debates (I have to read it again, it has been a while).

They also just completely changed key messages.  Remember the guy at the recruiting station who was missing a leg, who stated the mobile infantry, ""made me the man I am today"".  The movie used it as proof that the fascist government doesn't care for the well being of the soldiers.  In the book he is later met by the protagonists with his top of the line prosthetics.  He explains that he doesn't wear them at reception specifically so that recruits understand the stakes.  If they join out of ignorance, it is not worthy of citizenship.  They must willingly partake in the risk to show they deserve a path to citizenship.

Remember the knife in the hand scene, in the book it was an interesting monologue about the use of appropriate force.  It was well thought out and reasoned.

Others may disagree with my take on the book, and as I said it has been a while since I read it, but it was so much more than ""Government fascist and bad"".  If you read it, you may not agree with Heinlein's proposition, but man oh man is it so much deeper than the (admittedly enjoyable) movie.


EDIT: My goodness that's a block of text,  sorry for the long reply.  I guess I really resent the twisting of that book.

TLDR:  The book is a very nuanced thought experiment, the movie actively tries to ridicule those thoughts in a great action movie."

"2347",2347,"hxzxl41",5,1,"/r/Conservative"," Its way too late to do anything in 2022.

1. The European Union imports 27% of its crude oil, 41% of its natural gas, and 47% of its coal from Russia. With regards to natural gas, Germany's reliance on Russia is over 50%. Europe will not - **cannot** - turn off the spigot of Russian energy on a month's notice; Trump tried to curb Russia's energy influence vis-a-vis Nordstream 2 at least as far back as 2018 (https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/trump-begins-nato-summit-with-nord-stream-2-attack/) and did halt it briefly in 2019 (https://apnews.com/article/c7e7f8430df21f9fe77acba9549c9106) but Biden waived those sanctions in early 2021. Russia has immense leverage over Europe and Nordstream 2 would only increase it. 

2. Trump was expanding American energy production and exporting more energy to Europe (e.g. in 2017, to the Three Seas initiative countries: https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/06/trump-natural-gas-europe-leaders.html); instead Biden has curtailed and blocked production and set us on course to once again be a net importer of energy instead of an exporter - in fact in 2021 we imported more oil from Russia than any previous year: (https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=MTTIM_NUS-NRS_1&f=M).

3. The Obama administration and Europe both collectively shrugged in 2014 after Putin took Crimea. Obama said as much as ""Cut it out, Vlad"" and everyone rattled some sanctions but Europe's dependence on Russian exports only increased since then. What did that communicate to Putin? That predates Trump but it also informed his policy motives with regards to Russia - as far as Trump was concerned, clearly if the world wasn't going to actually treat Russia as a hostile enemy then we might as well treat them respectfully as a sovereign nation and try to find some common ground, and he said as much (which the subservient media spun into a years long Trump loves Putin narrative). Instead of that happening, the Democrat party and neocon Republicans spent 4-5 years demonizing Russia over a fake collusion hoax and fomenting as much hatred by half the domestic population against Russia as there had ever been during the Cold War. That sabotaged any chances Trump might have had to shift US-Russian relations toward a more positive path.

Trump had the right foreign policy direction early in his term and had we carried it out with diligence, Russia would have been poorer and had less leverage over Europe than they do now. You can thank Democrats, neocons, European socialists and the domestic media for working their hardest to denigrate and thwart every move he made to avoid a situation like we see now. Had the bureaucratic deep state in our government supported the President instead of trying to backstab him and the seeds Trump planted in 2017 and 2018 been able to grow forward to 2022, Trump wouldn't have had to deal with the current situation, period."

"2376",2376,"hxv6quk",3,1,"/r/Conservative","Two weeks ago I went to my first appointment with my new endocrinologist. She was the first doctor to say something that made me feel not crazy.

I got vaccinated back in April of last year with my second shot in May. Pretty normal stuff. A few days later when I was out on a ride on my bike I noticed that my heart rate was higher than normal on that hill. I persevered and made it to the top. Over the next six months that happened with increasing frequency. In November I was on a very easy ride, maybe 100W if you're into numbers, and my heart rate was going crazy. On my way back home, skipping any hills, my heart rate topped out over 200 BPM.

This was concerning.

I started putting off calling a doctor like so many guys. My wife convinced me to go, thankfully.

The first doctor when told that ""I think it might be due to the vaccine?"", well he just responded somewhat reflexively that ""the vaccine is safe and effective; now go see a cardiologist.""

The second doctor, the cardiologist, did a bunch of tests. It turns out I was in atrial fibrillation maybe 1% of the time. He put me on calcium channel blockers. When asked about potential vaccine connections he was a bit more circumspect: ""there are so many things that can cause this, it may be, it may not be, but the vaccines are a good thing.""

The results of the blood tests from the first doc finally came in: hyperthyroidism. A bunch of annoyance later I finally got an appointment.

She asked when I started getting these symptoms. ""Doctor, please don't hate me for this, and I'm not an anti-vaxxer and I got my first dose immediately after being eligible, but I started getting this right after my second vaccination."" I was already setting this up to fail. ""Oh, I've seen a bit uptick in thyroid issues along with a bunch of autoimmune diseases. It can cause thyroiditis, Grave's Disease, Hashimoto's Disease. Whenever someone comes in with something I start having to ask around to see if anyone else has seen that.""

I swear I was being gaslighted for the past couple of months and I was going crazy.

It doesn't solve anything just by that, but it at least makes me feel better.

It turns out that I now have both Hashimoto's as well as Graves' diseases. Fun times. Both of these are autoimmune diseases and I'll likely be on drugs for the rest of my life to combat this."

For any folks who don't know, in Canada the reigning party can call elections at any time by claiming a vote to pass a bill is also a confidence vote in the government's leadership. If the government loses the confidence of the house, an election is called.

It's a sad example of how democracy is often wielded as a threat in Canada because the ruling party knows that voters don't like being forced to return to the polls more often than needed.

Trump also did sign the first few Coof spending bills, which massively expanded the deficit at the same time the Fed increased the money supply by more than 25%.

None of that is to say that Biden didn't do anything to make the situation substantially worse. He did, on the spending, taxation, and regulatory angles. The Fed has continued to print money under Biden. But Trump should not get a pass, either."

1\. Once again, ""classical liberal"" and ""clearly on our side of the aisle"" are not mutually exclusive terms. A classical liberal can be either conservative or progressive. In the case of Dave Rubin, he seemed to move from progressive to conservative (due to woke cancel culture) while remaining fundamentally a classical liberal the entire time ([Allen 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utv4yDYFZX4)). In that interview, the host Virginia Allen remarked how classical liberals must be shocked at what wokeism has done to that side of the fence. ""What happened to my party?"" liberals must be asking themselves, she said.

""Well, they‚Äôre conservatives now,"" Rubin replied. ""I mean, that really is the truth."" And there he touches on a point that often goes unnoticed. See, I don't think people like Rubin or Joe Rogan have moved away from the left, really, so much as the left has moved a great deal further left in their rabid pursuit of progressive extremism. With the lefties pushing so much further left, what was center-left 20 years ago is now considered center-right. Progressive extremists pushed radically left while everyone else basically remained where they were. Classical liberals, Rubin said, know that ""liberalism in that sense has been destroyed"" by the lefties, that the left ""has run roughshod over all the things that they cared about.""

2\. It is not disingenuous to consider him a liberal when he self-identifies as such (ibid.), talking about his ""good liberal roots."" (He sells a ""Classical Liberal"" t-shirt on his show's merchandizing web page.) He's just unabashed about being a conservative one."

At any point, if a majority of MPs  feel they don't like how things are going in government, they can have a vote of no confidence.  Major pieces of legislature are often seen as confidence bills. Because if the ruling party can't pass important legislature, then why are they running things?  If the ruling party fails to win enough votes in a confidence vote then elections are triggered and hopefully the next group of MPs can get it sorted out. 

For context, they had an election last year.  Also elections are expensive so if your party is still in debt financing the last election, you might not want new elections.  Doubly so if you are a small minority party in alliance with the ruling party who doesn't have a majority in parliament."

It‚Äôs not even just this new wave of authoritarianism, if you think America is divided we are so much worse. This government and the Social Dems actively encouraged BLM rioters when they tore down statues of our founding father and decapitated them. I know Americans aren‚Äôt fond of royalty but we are (generally) and BLM also tore down a statue of Queen Victoria who was (for the time) a great Monarch and granted us our independence. The leader of the NDP (Social Dems) said [‚Äúour Canada is a place of racism‚Äù](https://youtu.be/i94sA64VzMA) and he and JT now view pride in our flag as ‚Äúwhite supremacy‚Äù

That‚Äôs just the social side our economy is even worse. Our cities rank amongst the least affordable *on the planet* because of brain dead Liberal policies. To them the idea of us all living in single family homes is pure evil, so they demand we all live in shoebox condos and cram ourselves into 3 cities. They then turn around and are stunned that CoL is skyrocketing. 

[**Housing debt makes up 96% of our GDP**](https://betterdwelling.com/canadian-mortgage-debt-reached-96-of-gdp-growth-beginning-to-slow/amp/) according to a recent study and our average home price is currently $750,000 nationally and $1.2M in the 3 previously mentioned cities. Additionally housing increases at a rate of *20-30% / yr on average*, some areas like here in Toronto are even worse. My parents bought their home for $1.2M 2 years ago, and their neighbour just sold their smaller house for $1.9M. 

Our Liberal government also continues to import **1.3M people every 2-3 years** because 5 foreigners have no problem living together in $700,000 condo. It also serves the purpose of suppressing wages which is by design. Of course if you point any of this out you‚Äôre a ‚Äúracist‚Äù.

Our only competitive advantage was our natural resources but the left has utterly gutted that industry. Last year they allowed rioters to attack and harass employees building a pipeline through aboriginal land the locally elected chiefs voted to approve. Not to mention the lumber industry which is obviously vital in building housing, but the left says it‚Äôs evil too.

You‚Äôd think all of the above would make the Left extremely unpopular but nope, their cultishness puts Democrats‚Äô to shame. Their only response is either ‚ÄúABC!‚Äù (Anyone but Conservative) or ‚Äúcan you imagine how bad things would be if the Cons were in power?‚Äù. 

There isn‚Äôt even any hope really of a Conservative minority government because in the Parliamentary system unless you win a majority, the reigning party gets to ask the house to form government first. If the other parties agree the ruling (Liberal) party is still in power despite losing the election. The NDP leader has also said he will *never* support a Con government ergo he will back JT until the end unless the Cons win a majority which is unlikely.

Them declaring Martial Law is basically just the natural end point of all these policies and their hatred for those not like them. If you read the /r/Ontario threads on the truckers their hated is on full display, I‚Äôve seen comments calling for them to be hanged.

Diplomacy and geopolitics is not exactly a game where everyone plays fair and is expected to get along. Everyone is out for their own interests as states and they will use whatever advantages they can to get ahead. It is very machiavellian, but it comes down to basic human nature. That is how diplomacy has always been conducted, the issue is when diplomacy fails and leads to war. 

If anything when everyone is out for themselves it makes diplomacy far easier because you can more reasonably expect what the person on the other side of the table wants and will do instead of like the EU where you might be talking to a German, but are dealing with some issue about Greece or just the collective overall.

Also so you are saying the two breakaway republics should have self determination, what about the rest of Ukraine who still consider those two areas integral parts of their nation? Do their opinions and understanding of their country not matter? Only those break away republics and Russia‚Äôs?

I‚Äôve worked Canadian elections before and what will happen is each riding will have dozens and dozens of polling stations.   For example in the city I grew up in of 100k people was considered it‚Äôs own riding.    In my neighbourhood there was two polling locations (two elementary schools) and there were locations in each neighbourhood.   Inside each location is multiple polling stations,  on you‚Äôre voter registration card (which gets mailed to every person who files a tax return)  it will tell you which polling station you vote at.  It‚Äôs done by hand with paper ballots.  You get your ballot, mark it, place it in a box.   When the polls close those boxes are moved to the returning office where the two people who ran that polling station will then count the votes (some times there will be an additional person who helps them).  The times I did this I think we counted between 1500-2000 votes and then the results are given to the returning officers who run the returns office.   It took a couple hours to count, and recount to make sure.   After that the results get reported.

They are one of the largest exports of technology (microchips) to the U.S. in addition to supplying the US with large amounts of industrial goods (tools and fasteners). So, knowing the effective impact on the US, Trump took a hardline approach to China on protecting trade routes with freedom of navigation drills supporting their sovereignty (without fully recognizing it diplomatically and causing hard issues with China) and supplying their military.  Ukraine offers little value to the US in terms of export goods and the such, but are important in Europe‚Äôs geopolitics and securing the pipelines that extend through Ukraine. That‚Äôs exactly why Trump supported European countries taking an active role in their militaries and having them stand up to big brother Russia. He supported them, but didn‚Äôt get us needlessly involved in European politics that could have had lasting implications for the US.  As someone else stated, the Biden Administration has largely been engaging in saber rattling because the U.S. has very little to gain from the Ukrainian conflict since they aren‚Äôt a NATO ally, don‚Äôt provide many exports to the US, and aren‚Äôt really a part of US military strategy."

Timing is pretty suspect considering it coincides with major global events (Russia, Econ downturn, potential China-Taiwan). Furthermore, the coordination and funding of Canada's convoy was beyond suspicious- especially considering the sizable involvement of French-Canadian (Quebec Separatists perhaps). Regardless of what's going on (maybe it is really grassroots), the window was kind of missed and the convoy on DC will be an optics disaster. 

Canada just got crushed due to the convoy, why would things be any different here? Canada, a nation with limited infrastructure, effectively zero military, only a couple major ports and border crossings, could effectively be completely blockaded and starved out, yet instead everyone capitulated and they're not effectively under martial law. Here, a nation with extensive infrastructure and grotesquely funded military, is going to somehow capitulate to a blockade of DC (an abandoned ghetto)?  Could, you know, go help blockade Canada but would strangely prefer to all convoy to DC...why? 

Here's why! Because the media wants it. Imagine convincing your viewers that DC is the centralized authority and that their salvation radiates from that disgusting pit. Never mind the people that serve and keep the nation running, your salvation and food stampies come from our heros (like AOC) in DC. Now imagine getting these nice shots of ""Evil White Supremacist Terrorist Insurrectionists"" in front of OUR Democracy! Sells their image much better than, ""Evil  Drumpft supporters blockade various ports and border crossings cutting off food supply and reminding us all that they (the workers) have power, not the embezzlers in DC""...Yeah, I don't think their base would like that realization.

Each electoral district, a riding, votes for its representative in the federal government (a Member of Parliament aka MP). The leader of the political party with the most elected MPs is asked by the Governor General to form a government, and the party's leader becomes Prime Minister.

The government needs the support of a majority of MPs to pass any laws. Usually Canada has a ""majority"" government, where the party in power has over 50% of the seats in Parliament.

Trudeau actually has a ""minority"" government, meaning his party won the most seats but not 50% + 1. His legislation is passed only through the cooperation of another party's MPs.

As for voting from east to west, that's essentially how it works in practice.

Ridings are all roughly equal in population. So in the heavily populated areas of Canada, urban Ontario and Quebec, there are a lot more ridings than anywhere else.

Polls close I think at 7pm local time. But 7pm in the west is 10pm in the east. Given the headstart on counting, and the massive disparity in population, federal elections are usually mathematically won by seats in the east before the polls even close on the west coast.

This means you get a government that perpetually focuses on the east, as that is its voter base.

The underlying data manipulation is a far greater concern. It has caused not just one country to react, but almost all of them.

As far as the for some reason you added in there. It is because of the ""invader"" sometimes the immune system goes overboard it's actually why covid is as bad as it is. The protein isn't special in the regard. For instance in the the protein in mrna vaccines has a lipid shell

This is going to be a copy pasta from me previously explaining this. This is what is in the moderna vaccine.

I can give the full scientific breakdowns for each (I will link it though it's a beefy piece of work.)

---

Nucleoside-modified mRNA encoding the viral spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2

That's the active ingredient and is broken down within two days as messenger RNA usually is (because the body produces it, and free floating Mrna ends being quickly broken down by enzymes)

2[(polyethylene glycol (PEG))-2000]-N,N-ditetradecylacetamide

1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine

Cholesterol

These four are the lipid shell that is needed so the bodies enzymes don't IMMEDIATELY break the MRNA down. They are very common and well tolerated. There are some sensitivities polyethylene glycol (it's in a lot of things food wise, and certain formulations are literally miralax) Folks fill out a sheet to for the folks giving it to find if that's a concern.
Basically think of the lipid layer as a capsule pill. The drug is on the inside and the capsule is so the body doesn't absorb the drug too quickly or not get any benefit out of it.

Sodium chloride (salt)
Monobasic potassium phosphate
Potassium chloride
Dibasic sodium phosphate dihydrate

Those are salts. They are very basic things that are being used so the acidity level matches your bodies acidity level. All of which are common, and well tolerated.

And finally sucrose. Yes they put a little sugar(precursor to sugar) to help prevent those components from getting damaged from the freezing.
---

There is a reason hit pieces focus on the ""spike protein"". Despite the fact the body treats it like spare parts if not for the lipid shell. It isn't special. You experience systemic or localized reactions to any invader. In this case the sore arm is a localized reaction and chills are systemic(body wide) reactions. Examples Tylenol produces a more systemic response where as topically applied lidocaine produces a localized response.

Please note this is a very high level overview and isn't comprehensive. If you want comprehensive then I can provide that in whatever skill level you feel you are.

Contrary to opinions there are, were and will be dozens of scientists pulling the slow down string at any given point. The difference is they are not talking to you because if you hear slow down you will think it means there is something inherently wrong probably permanently. Where as if they tell another scientist to slow down it means this area needs to be looked at post haste. It doesn't mean there is something bad but it does not mean there isn't.

Somebody else needs to pick it, transport it, prepare it, and wrap it in those colorful boxes on the store shelf.

If these jobs paid more, then food would cost more, and the poor, and lower middle class could no longer afford it.

These jobs used to pay far less just a generation ago, even free a few generations before that, (slavery).

Wages even on farm workers are far higher than a generation ago because of tractors, and other production increases. 

Before industrialization EVERYONE, and I do mean everyone was a farm worker. 

From small children, women, men, and even the elderly worked on growing food from sun up to sunset. 

Mothers carried new borns on their backs, toddlers carried the empty sacks.

Some like Irish immigrants were paid only a share of the crops.

If you wanted a house, you built it yourself.

So putting those things together, the current Conservative party has absolutely failed. If they want to win, they need to be hard core fiscal conservatives, low taxes, cut red tape and reduce government spending and get the deficit under control. They also need to be socially responsible. Yes, people can choose not to take the vaccine. But, if they don't want the vaccine, then either a. they can't participate in stuff, or b. they can't use up hospital space. If they choose to forgo medical treatment(the vaccine), then that's their right but they should stay home if they get severe COVID because they made their choice to forgo medical treatment when they didn't get vaccinated.

Right now, because there is no principled fiscal conservative opposition, then Trudeau is going to win the next election."

Beloved host and advocate for blue-collar workers Mike Rowe explained in December the real meaning behind the highly-popularized, ‚Äúclever,‚Äù and ‚Äúhysterical‚Äù chant.

‚ÄúThe times that we‚Äôre living in right now are forcing lots of people on both sides of the aisle to look at a thing, or hear a thing, and be told that what they‚Äôre seeing and what they‚Äôre hearing is not real,‚Äù Rowe said. ‚ÄúAnd you can‚Äôt do that to people indefinitely and expect them not to push back somehow. You can‚Äôt tell people that the border is secure and then show them images of tens of thousands of people flooding over it. You can‚Äôt tell people that the evacuation of Afghanistan was a success and then show them people falling off of a plane. ‚Ä¶ And you can‚Äôt ask people who are watching a NASCAR race at home, who clearly hear the crowd yelling ‚ÄòF*** Joe Biden‚Äô to pretend that what they‚Äôre really hearing is ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs Go Brandon.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúI think what‚Äôs happened is people have just become sick and tired of being told that what they‚Äôre seeing and what they‚Äôre hearing is not what they‚Äôre seeing and hearing,‚Äù Rowe emphasized.

‚ÄúAnd this is the perfect trope,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think people who yell it are necessarily enemies of the president. I think they‚Äôre enemies of being told that what they‚Äôre seeing and what they‚Äôre hearing isn‚Äôt real, that it‚Äôs somehow a figment of their imagination. People are sick of that.‚Äù"

No, you don't. You're paying for your healthcare via your higher taxes.

I previously had a government job here in the U.S. where I had what was effectively ""free/subsidized"" through my employer dental (it was basically, on very small scale, what government provided dental would look like) as one of the benefits and it was an absolutely fucking nightmare to use. I would call the number they provided, it would take about 10 times calling over the course of several days (during normal business hours, mind you) to finally get someone to pick up who would direct me to another number that actually had to call to set up an appointment. When I finally could get a hold of someone after several days of phone tag, I'd have to commit to one of the only two available time slots at odd times about 4 months into the future. I fucking hated.

I now got to a typical, small town, private practice clinic (with private dental insurance that's about $15-20 per month). The difference is night and day. I call, someone immediately picks up, they're very friendly, and there's a lot of times for me the choose from that I don't have to rearrange my schedule for. And it the past, when I have had my appointment at the last minute, they can reschedule for something else within the next few weeks. 

Well worth it. And if I didn't have private insurance, I would simply pay out of pocket about $100-120 twice per year for cleanings so it's not much of difference either. I'd much rather pay for good service than get something for ""free"" from our government.

The COVID mandates and restrictions follow the same thought.  Punishing people for breaking restrictions meant to ""keep people and Canada safe"". Even putting some in prison.


Invoking the emergency powers act for the first time in history to put down a non-violent protest.  That allowed them to basically do what they wanted and resulted in the seizure of property, freezing of funds, and disregard for life when the RCMP trampled people with their horses.  A lot of them will probably spend time in jail simply for protesting their government.  They even threatened people who donated to the protest.  

You don't see the similarities?"

I imagine other conservatives feel similarly. Also, the left's environmental policies actively punish the poor, whom the left claim to be champions of.

The original sin that led to WWII was the oppressive, punitive Treaty of Versailles that directly led to the rise of Hitler through democratic means. Millions of Germans were left stranded in Sudetenland and Danzig and forced to live under foreign rules in the interwar period. The tragedy repeated itself post-WWII when as many as [2.5 million Germans died and 14.6 million were ethnically cleansed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_and_expulsion_of_Germans_(1944%E2%80%931950)). Even Anschluss made sense because Austria and Prussia (founder of German Empire aka Second Reich) were the leading states of the predominantly German-speaking Holy Roman Empire (aka First Reich). The forced abdications of both the Habsburgs and Hohenzollerns (Kaiser Wilhelm II) removed the 2 countries' royalists from the equation.

Putin's 2014 annexation of Crimea at least could be justified on ethnic ground and self-determination as Crimea had a Russian majority and voted to unite with Russia. Even Donetsk could be justified on similar grounds. But Ukrainians have never been Russians, so invading the entire Ukraine is blatant empire building. Just like Hitler lost his moral high ground when he invaded the entire Czechoslovakia. There was a reason the USSR downplayed race, but rather strictly focused on the communist ideology. They knew pushing a Russian chauvinist narrative would immediately lead to ethnic tensions and never-ending civil wars, just like Yugoslavia immediately collapsed when they replaced communism with Serbian chauvinism post-Cold War. Heck, many of the most prominent Soviet Union leaders were not even Russians. Stalin was Georgian. Khruschev was Ukrainian. Trotsky was Jewish (Tito was not a Serb either. He was born to a Croat father and Slovene mother). Having ethnic minority as leaders reinforced the idea that these communist states were ""color-blind,"" which was what held them together."

It's crazy when you live it.  

150 wasn't the total number of deaths for my ICU in a small-ish hospital, it's the number of deaths that I personally witnessed working 3 days/week over two years. Some that I had connections with, that went from high flow oxygen, to bipap, to intubated, to dead. I learned the hard way to not get very attached to people.  

In the before times, I'd see around 5 deaths per year and they were usually people who had suffered for a long time and it was just their time to go.  

COVID was a really scary time, people dying all around you, including the occasional coworker, with a skewed sense of mortality wondering if you'll be next. Seeing all of the mistakes taking place, wondering that if you servive if will you be sued? Will you even want to live if you survive?

So how is a fascist government, which is a marrying of corporate and state interests (Mussolini's words, by the by) to effect total control, anywhere on the right?

I'm sure FDR and his administration would have been fawning all over right-wing ideology though, right?

It is concerning but we need to avoid going to war over this. Focus on developing and strengthening our own military. Contribute with installations of anti missile systems in Europe. Force Europe to pick up it's fair share of defense by making it clear the us will not serve as their police, etc.

Self determination is a fundamental human right. There is no 'right' for the nation of Ukraine to control those territories. Governments only have sovereignty over a territory insofar as the *actual* people in that territory support that government. That is a fundamental stance undertaken by our very foundational documents...

1.  make america great again goes to traditionalism and this misguided belief in the ""good ole' days"" and that we should return to an era of rampant sexism, racism, and just a generally shittyness for anyone who wasn't white.
2. Similar to #1.  Honestly, my answer to #1 might be better placed here.  I concede that.
3. Any acknowledgement of Trump over his Presidency will tell you that he didn't really plan things out and that the Republican party was just ""whatever trump wants"" without any foresight.
4. ""Fake News"" is the beginning of ""disagreement is treason"".  Anything that doesn't agree with his narrative is fake and he lashed out at reporters for bringing attention to anything he disagreed with.
5. Fear of difference goes hand-in-hand with anti-immigration and Muslim rhetoric that was spewed his entire administration.
6. This one every politician does, its just what politicians due, can't really fault him for that.
7. ""Deep State"" is a plot based obsession.
8. Democrats were both incompetent his entire administration and also somehow capable of preventing anything he tried accomplishing.  Everything good was because of him and everything bad was the fault of everyone else.
9. Eh, I don't really have a good one for this.  I might come back to this later if i think of something that applies here.
10. Paying the slight iota of attention to him in 4 years makes this one self-explanatory.
11. Same as 10
12. lol, same as 10
13. Damn, same as 10.  Its almost like paying attention to his actions and words makes most of these self explanatory.

"4876",4876,"hy3v4b8",3,1,"/r/Conservative","The problem is that politicians politicized the vaccines, overpromised on the effectiveness of the vaccines, and conditioned the removal of mandates on the effectiveness of vaccines.

The vaccines have been effective, but not in the way that they were advertised by politicians.  Politicians lied to everyone when they claimed vaccination prevented transmission.  They don't.  Vaccines never have.  Sterilizing immunity is a myth, but politicians used the popular belief in that myth to trick people.  The hypothesis that vaccinated people would be less likely to transmit the virus, on account of a theoretical reduced viral load, was absurd, because attenuated symptoms increase the likelihood that a person continues to expose other people.  IOW, with attenuated symptoms, a person is more likely to become a Typhoid Mary.

The vaccines have been effective in reducing the likelihood of hospitalization and death.  The degree to which they've been effective depends on the strain.  They were more effective against the original strain.  The fact that vaccinated people have died is not proof that the vaccines don't work.  The fact that vaccinated people represent a majority of hospitalizations is also not proof the vaccines don't work (this is a function of the vaccination rate in the general population, not the effectiveness of the vaccines).  Some proportion of people are always going to die from this virus, because it has the ability to infect the lungs, and there are always going to be people who are on death's doorstep.  

Honestly, the best course of action would have been to let low-risk people continue with their daily lives, and advise high-risk people to isolate.  The population of low-risk people would have quickly developed strong natural immunity, possibly herd immunity, and then when vaccines became available, high-risk people could get a leg up on the virus and lower their risk of hospitalization or death."

There are 338 constituencies/seats (called ""ridings"" in Canada), and the party that wins the most seats is given the first opportunity to form government.

The Liberals (Trudeau's party) currently have 159 seats, which is less than half of the total seats up for grabs, meaning they need the support of another party (typically the NDP -- the socialist party) to pass any bills. I would say maybe 90-95% of the time the NDP supports the Liberals, under their currently leader they're seen as an extension of the Liberal Party.

So all of that to say, it depends on *where* those votes were, if they were all, or mostly all, from ridings where one party won by a large margin, it probably doesn't matter.

"5080",5080,"hxv5syf",4,1,"/r/Conservative","I see the scenario OP laid out, or the following alternative:

We will continue to see people move to the states that align more with their political leanings. As a result, the red states and blue states will become more and red and blue, respectively. If things continue to the trend this way rhetorically, we will see a national divorce that will be mutual. However, the blue states will align themselves more with the likes of Canada, Western Europe and China.

The separated red states will be demonized on a global level. And once they have the backing they need from other global powers, the blue states will sanction the newly divorced red states and attempt to suffocate them into submission through resource restriction, etc. The red states will retaliate violently, and a war will breakout. Tens of millions of people will die. America will be destroyed, and China will swoop in and establish their governing system. Trans people, openly gay public figures who promulgated fringe ideals, and far leftists who called themselves Antifa or Antifa apologists, basically all who complained about the petty inconveniences and oppression under our current system, will be identified and sent to re-education camps or executed. Some portions of red states will be able to stave off China's initial aggression, but they will never be able to reorganize. China will repeatedly use experimental weaponry in those portions of the country: nanotechnology, bioweapons, smart bombs, etc.

My prediction goes off the rails at this point.

Over time, perhaps in a 100 years or so, some of the heirs of the dipshits that thought they were on the right side of history will decide that being plugged into an alternate reality for their entire lives isn't want they want. They will attempt to rise up and overthrow whatever regime that holds power, but I'm sure at that point the mind control devices and weaponry will be nearly insurmountable, so they will fail.

At some point, the Chino-American government will carve out funding for a scientist named Anthony Fauci VI who specializes in black hole research. Despite warnings from other scientists about the dangers of black hole simulation, Anthony Fauci VI will continue his experimentation and accidentally create a black hole in a lab in Roseburg, Oregon. It will expand extremely slowly, yet it will consume everything in its path.

Anthony Fauci VI will be brought before a special tribunal where Chino-american politicians will interrogate him; however, being an expert liar, he will evade imprisonment and half the country will call him a hero. Other scientists, who have ties to Anthony Fauci VI, will receive a massive subsidy and invent a device that will be able to create a gravitational constant equal to that of that the black hole, effectively putting an end to its expansion. Unfortunately, an unforeseen circumstance will arise when it's discovered that the device emits an enormous amount of radiation that is highly transferrable from one human to another. In an effort to counteract the effects of the radiation, they will create an injectable substance containing nanoparticles that will absorb the radiation. They will doctor the trial results and ignore any long-term risk of the injection and it will prematurely be declared a scientific triumph. All of this will occur during the same time that Chino-European scientists invent their own gravitational device, but one that doesn't emit radiation. They will try to bring attention to it, but the Chino-Americans, not wanting to shed light on the failings of their own subsidized experiment, will arrest the Chino-European scientists, confiscate their research and execute them by throwing them into the black hole."

**Classical liberals** were committed to stripping the church and state of their centralized authoritarian power and dispersing it into the hands of a free people, arguing for individual secular freedom instead of centralized authority like unelected monarchs. Out of this root grew branches that would lead to **progressives** on the one hand and **conservatives** on the other, two branches sharing the same trunk in common.

In other words, someone identifying as a ""liberal"" doesn't necessarily indicate whether they are progressive or conservative; they could be either one. A *progressive* liberal believes in using a democratically elected government to facilitate or force progress, whereas a *conservative* liberal believes that government should conserve the social and economic integrity and norms of a free society that is left alone as much as possible.

Just for the sake of interest, Miessler does [a nice breakdown of the classical liberals](https://danielmiessler.com/blog/a-visual-breakdown-of-intellectual-dark-web-idw-political-positions/) in the intellectual dark web (such as Rubin, Same Harris, Rogan, etc.) and where they sit on the progressive to conservative scale. (None of them are alt-right.) I highly recommend reading that succinct article. It's refreshingly self-reflective and honest."

It‚Äôs also acknowledging the moral argument of popular sovereignty as it relates to the connection between a people and their land.

"5311",5311,"hxzzmq0",3,1,"/r/Conservative","I do think that long term private schooling online at home is the best way forward for most kids. The social aspect of things can get figured out via clubs and whatnot. 

Imagine as a parent if you signed your kid up for online school and at the beginning of each year you basically got to pick class options and courses specifically tailored for your child. Parents would have far more control and influence over what their kids learn and individualized education would be a breeze. Your kid reads at a high level? No problem. Math whizz? Easy. Maybe needs a bit of remedial help with physics? No problem. Good luck with that in traditional public schools. 

Instead of CRT and Karl Marx like they‚Äôre getting currently in the public schools you could have them taking Latin or Ancient Greek or advanced calculus or anything else the public schools don‚Äôt offer. It would not be difficult to include more options for technical education too like auto repair and wood shop and create partnerships with local businesses for apprenticeships in the trades and such so kids can get the hands on experience along with the theoretical stuff. 

Basically what I‚Äôm saying is let taxpayers withhold payments to public schools and go this route instead. We can maintain a basic infrastructure so that all children have basic access to a public education for a fraction of the cost of brick and mortar schools. Naturally parents could pay out of pocket for extras. It‚Äôll be cheaper and probably more effective at actual education. We could even probably take a fraction of the money saved and invest it in public libraries and such so even the poorest and literal homeless children would still have options to access internet based education.

‚ÄúWhite privilege‚Äù and ‚Äúmale privilege‚Äù aren‚Äôt people saying you didn‚Äôt work hard. What it means is that the fact that you‚Äôre a man, or have white skin, was not something that got in your way. For women who want to buy a house in our 30s, there is an *extra* obstacle solely because of the fact that we‚Äôre women. If you‚Äôre a woman in Texas you can be forced to have a child against your will. And then face discrimination in the workplace for it, including a much lower chance of promotion, and much lower chance of pay. That‚Äôs on top of women already making less money. That‚Äôs on top of the fact that women-dominated careers, like nursing and teaching, are undeniably the two most grossly underpaid jobs in this country.

I hope you can understand how frustrating it is to still have to explain this to white men in 2022 because you don‚Äôt want to just set aside your pride for 5 minutes and Google what privilege even means. That you won‚Äôt even read the very article you‚Äôre commenting on.

I‚Äôm literally 7 months pregnant and if anything were to go wrong, that I‚Äôd need an abortion to save my own life, there are literally politicians in my state who are trying to take away ALL access to abortion. One politician in particular has literally tweeted, in response to ‚Äúthere are instances where abortion saves lives‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat lives?‚Äù This same politician met with the president of my company just a couple months ago. And our company undoubtedly wrote him a fat check to get re-elected just so he can deregulate our industry. The men I see at work every day, who undoubtedly think they‚Äôre not misogynistic, just put a slim chance of more company profit over me having rights over my own body.

And I have to sit here and hear you complain that you‚Äôre a victim of discrimination because your friend was just as fed up with you as I am? Like fucking hell. I really tried to be as civil, and empathetic as possible when starting this comment. But literally nothing will get through to some of you. It‚Äôs just so fucking selfish and bullheaded for you to act like you‚Äôre the victim with all this shit going on. You, specifically, are a bad guy for fucking making everything about you.

Section Three of the Fourteenth Amendment disqualifies an individual from serving as a state or federal official if that person has ""*engaged in insurrection or rebellion against*"" the United States. This includes the funding, instigating, promoting, or facilitating in an insurrection. It was a clause written within the context of the Civil War but was also included to theoretically apply for members of future rebellions or insurrections against the United States.
  

  
A person who through **prompting** causes a lawless act is guilty of that act.
  

  
""Imminent lawless action"" is a standard currently used that was established by the **United States Supreme Court** in Brandenburg v. Ohio (**1969**) It defined the limits of freedom of speech. Brandenburg clarified what constituted a ""clear and present danger"", the standard established by Schenck v. United States (1919). 
  

  
This Supreme Court Ruling firmly established that speech that merely advocated violence could be illegal. Under the imminent lawless action test, speech is not protected by the First Amendment if the speaker intends to incite a violation of the law that is both imminent and likely.
  

  
**Cawthorn** who spoke at the pre-attack rally, is quoted as saying if elections ‚Äúare stolen,‚Äù it will ‚Äúlead to one place, and that‚Äôs bloodshed,‚Äù and added that he is ‚Äúwilling to defend liberty at all costs‚Äù.

I can‚Äôt make current leadership perform better. And sitting out an election isn‚Äôt going to ‚Äúteach them a lesson,‚Äù which I so commonly hear. It‚Äôs only going to help keep those same candidates we lament retain power - Democrats and Republicans alike.

We need to get out and vote for FUTURE candidates we want to see make changes versus those that are regressive. That‚Äôs what midterms are about. They aren‚Äôt some ‚Äúyes or no‚Äù referendum of the party at large. And treating it that way will only hurt our interests."

I believe I've thoroughly debunked the idiotic rake outrage. You could have too if you cared instead of just listening to literal propaganda.

The moat comment is widely reported because it was in a book and the media is fucking stupid as I've shown. No one has confirmed it and Trump denied it. Didn't happen."

if her father is the primary on the insurance there are some things he has access to.  He can see the plans accumulators and he can confirm responsibility for claims to a limited degree, but it's illegal for him to obtain the specifics of any medical claim under her, or anything she talks to her insurance about without her full consent with very limited usually emergency situations.

Dude should be reported to his local medical board, and your niece should call his insurance provider or plan administrator and ask to remove any PHI authorization on file and ask them to put warning on her file about her dad's activity to try and deter future fraudulent PHI auths from showing up.  Insurance companies take this shit very seriously, if the father is getting private information illegally the insurance company can be held liable if he went through their channels to get it, so her mentioning potential fraud will perk their ears right the fuck up, even the bad insurance companies.

Also if this is her insurance and not her being a dependent on his insurance, that's an entire other batch of holy shit illegal.  Like if you aren't the primary on a plan, I can't even acknowledge the member has insurance with us without their express written or verbal consent.  The dad in that theoretical case is breaking so many laws he should really be in jail at that point.

Meanwhile many people getting student loans are ages 17-19... 17 isn't even adulthood in most states; and 18/19 can't legally drink in most states... Personal education and such aren't taught in most schools, and certainly isn't required either. Also bankers KNEW that the 08 recession was gonna happen eventually, it was dead predictable when they give out hundreds/thousands of mortgages to people who certainly cant pay them off. How the F were students supposed to see it coming for people going to school in the years of like 04-09?   And what about the students of say 2016-NOW?

Like we're in 22... and you can go back as far as like '04 so 18 YEARS AGO... and in that time frame there's only been like one decent stretch of time for graduates. 

Also of your australian solutions... Our student loans are also through the government. Yeah limiting college pricing would be good, but would do nothing to help tons of those already screwed over by one of the worst recessions we've had in like half a century and the worst pandemic we've had since the PLAGUE...

And he's not alone. He's not unusual. In the 2020 Democratic primary, Democratic voters voter for Biden. Black voters in particular are more likely to be moderate on the actual issues (this is related to higher religiosity among black Democrats compared to white Democrats). This leads them to stay home more often than voting R, but swinging from voting D to not voting is still a swing that changes outcomes, particularly in this era of hyper partisan voter turnout. A huge number of Americans also just don't pay attention and they basically guess when they vote, or vote on a whim. The quality of ads really effects them,. because they tend to go with the last thing they see/hear. And almost across the board, the Repubicans have an easier message to remember than Dems do, at least they way these issues get framed in the media and even by Dems themselves, a lot of the time.

Now, I agree that I think better messaging would help a lot. I also agree that moderates (read: Manchin and Sinema) are doing enormous damage and that the progressives would likely be in a better situation if BBB had passed and it Manchin had not singlehandedly doubled child poverty. These are real problems and they are mostly self inflicted wounds at the hands of two specific Democratic Senators, not the party as a whole."

The US Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, DC, affirmed the lower court's ruling in a blistering 68-page opinion written by Judge Patricia Millett.
  

  
""Benjamin Franklin said, at the founding, that we have '\[a\] Republic'‚Äî'if \[we\] can keep it.' The events of January 6th exposed the fragility of those democratic institutions and traditions that we had perhaps come to take for granted,"" Millett wrote.
  

  
Both the incumbent president and Congress determined that ""access to this subset of presidential communication records is necessary to address a matter of great constitutional moment for the Republic,"" she added.
  

  
""Former President Trump has given this court no legal reason to cast aside President Biden's assessment of the Executive Branch interests at stake, or to create a separation of powers conflict that the Political Branches have avoided,"" the ruling said.


  

  
The Supreme Court's January order specifically left unaddressed some key questions, including to what extent a former president can shield their documents from public release. The court wrote that these topics were ""unprecedented"" and ""raise serious and substantial concerns.""  
In the weeks since the Supreme Court declined to block the archives from turning over documents to the January 6 select committee, it surfaced that Trump took around 15 boxes of White House documents to his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida.  
NARA said in a letter to lawmakers on Friday that it communicated with Trump advisors about the materials last year, received the 15 boxes last month, and is still in the process of inventorying its contents. The records that Trump belatedly turned over reportedly include documents related to some of his most infamous moments like ""Sharpiegate,"" the doctored map of Hurricane Dorian's path.  
The agency said that among other things, it recently learned that some of the boxes Trump took with him contained classified national security information.

  
NARA recently asked the Justice Department to investigate whether Trump violated federal law by taking documents with him to Mar-a-Lago that should have been turned over to the archives at the end of his presidency.  
Legal experts have said that Trump's actions may have violated the Presidential Records Act, which requires presidents and White House staff to preserve official documents and communications, and turn those items over to the Archives at the end of a president's term.  
The January 6 Committee request for Trump's records comes as lawmakers try to piece together Trump's movements and actions on the day of the Capitol riot. Rep. Liz Cheney, the top Republican on the panel, has suggested that Trump's failure to immediately condemn rioters amounts to a dereliction of duty."""

I have a feeling that Biden is organizing economic penalties that will be so detrimental to Russia that they will think twice about ever taking these kinds of actions again. They lost nord stream 2, which is a huge blow to Russia. After crimea, Russia faced extremely mild punishment it felt like, which emboldened them to take this action. Yeah we levied some sanctions back then, and added crimea to the ofac sanctions list, but now Russia just lost their most important economic project, which is going to bring the pain to Russia. 

I do think we should temporarily boost domestic energy production to help European countries with their energy needs. But we‚Äôll see if Biden take a that step.

"8391",6289,"hy4arju",2,0,"/r/politics","Everyone saying that people like him because ‚Äúhe speaks fluent idiot so idiots understand him‚Äù or ‚Äúthe uneducated lap it up because he speaks like them‚Äù are missing the point. 

Here‚Äôs why people lap that shit up: the sense of American pride, nationalism, and superiority mixed in with a sense of fear and/or disdain. People are concerned about the border crisis, they think it‚Äôs a threat to security, the economy, and our way of life, and they look down on the migrants. They also look down on Mexico and Latin America as a whole. It isn‚Äôt such a leap, tbh Mexico isn‚Äôt nearly as powerful or stable as the US or Canada, however it is extremely bigoted. 

Trump in that quote is basically facepalming himself for not doing the exact same thing Putin is doing in Ukraine but at the Texas border. By him insinuating that we should just take over a swath of Mexico, not only does this satiate people‚Äôs fears over peace and security of the nation (which are already somewhat unfounded, but not entirely - cartel activity is a SIGNIFICANT security and safety risk and saying otherwise is naive), but it also gives people a sense of justice and goodwill, people think they are liberators and are going to give people better lives and strengthen America by adding more territory. Now, it‚Äôs easy to then state ‚Äúthese republicans could give a rats ass about liberating Mexicans they‚Äôd rather they all just fuck off‚Äù and that would be true for a small amount of Republicans, but not for most. Most republicans genuinely do not see themselves as racist and bear no ill will to minorities (in their heads) however they don‚Äôt realize how their actions and/or thoughts are bigoted. Then when you call them a racist they become offended because they genuinely do not believe that they are and feel insulted. This further ostracizes them and pushes them away from agreeing with liberal ideologies because they‚Äôve effectively been branded negatively, deserving or otherwise, which then makes them believe that liberals are these insane cancel culture freaks and that, in fact, they are the rational ones. 

I say all this because there is this sentiment among liberals today that Republican ideology can just be written off as stupid or idiotic and then move on. If you‚Äôre wondering why American polarization is at an all time high, this is what liberals are contributing to it. In order to make an effective argument against someone, and in order to change their minds, you must understand fully where the other side is coming from in order to effectively either dismantle it, or incorporate what the other side is saying that makes sense and dismantle what doesn‚Äôt. This goes for both sides of the aisle. Simply writing it off as idiotic doesn‚Äôt assuage any concerns and just pushes people away from each other. 

There‚Äôs a reason why Trump was almost re-elected, so many Americans have concerns that Trump was frighteningly effective at addressing. Without understanding why Trump was elected, and why he was almost re-elected, America is going to be stuck in this left-right feud for years to come, which isn‚Äôt good for anyone."

If all of these things come to pass, it‚Äôs likely the Democrats will lose on the typical number of seats for the ‚Äúin-power‚Äù party, somewhere in the 10 - 20 range.If, however, we see the annual inflation rate continuing to run amok, if Russia fully invades Ukraine, if the Fed follows through with 6 (or more) rate hikes, if the administration doesn‚Äôt take visible steps to secure the southern border, and if the DA‚Äôs in places like California and New York continue to play softball with the criminals‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.I believe we will likely see a landslide worse than the Democrats faced twelve years ago when they lost 63 seats.

Taub‚Äôs request wasn‚Äôt even subtle, it came in the form of a direct appeal to a foreign power for financial and/or material help in an American election. 

The dossier of materials Taub received came from the same GRU Russian Intelligence website that supplied Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign with ‚Äúunsolicited‚Äù information posted on a separate web outlet (WikiLeaks). This is a direct violation of the laws that are written to prevent foreign powers from interfering in American elections.
  

  
In addition, Taub used the donor lists supplied to form a donor PAC (unregistered). A PAC he was found guilty of illegally **embezzling $1,100,000** of the $1,600,000 donors had given. Taub admitted in court to spending the money on hookers, cigars, drinks, clothing, food, airfare, travel accommodations and strip clubs.

"10631",6513,"hxzkbbr",1,0,"/r/politics","As a single-ish dude, one of her marketing emails was FANTASTIC; I'm beginning to become a HUGE fan. 
  
""I‚Äôm an unmarried single woman running for office in the United States. Researchers say that while my bold run for PA-03 may be applauded on the career-front, I‚Äôm hurting my chances of finding a long-term partner to settle down with.
   
I say that‚Äôs his loss.
   
Societal norms, even in 2022, favor a man in a heterosexual partnership being the primary breadwinner and advise men to steer clear from entering relationships where they might be second or third in a woman‚Äôs priorities. There‚Äôs research and articles written warning men against marrying a ‚Äúcareer woman‚Äù because he‚Äôll find that she won‚Äôt be happy quitting her job and staying at home, the house will be dirtier, he‚Äôs more likely to fall ill, and there‚Äôs a high likelihood that marrying a career woman will result in divorce.
   
Damn right it will. If a man needs me to stay home, clean the house, and prevent him from falling ill, you better believe I‚Äôm filing for divorce.
   
But all of that talk aside, being a single woman running for office does come with some hardships. I recently spoke with another woman who already holds public office. She used to hold very similar views to marriage and ran for office as a single woman. However, she recently decided to get married because she said she needed emotional support. She said that being a woman in politics and running outside of a political machine can be incredibly lonely.
   
I might be single, but this race is not without love. I deeply love the people of this district. When I leave Philadelphia for a business trip or vacation and I catch sight of Philly‚Äôs skyline upon my return, my heart starts beating faster. I know that within the city limits are everyday people going about their waking hours, showing up for one another, building community. I also know that those same people are facing a lot of undeserved and unjust struggle. This is what has propelled me to run such a difficult race in such a toxic environment. It‚Äôs what sustains me through really hard days to keep going. It‚Äôs also what fills my heart when voters invite me into their living room to sit down and talk about our platform. Love. Radical love."""

Archives:  Are those missing documents ready yet?

Trump flunkey: Come and get them.

They will rail against China and applaud Trump being heavy handed with them, but don't seem to realize that they are about the only major power backing Russia in their obvious aggressive takeover of their neighbor.  So Trump is outright abandoning Europe, carrying water for Russia, and pissing on the other important power who agreed with his dangerously irresponsible appeasement of Putin.

"11801",6630,"hy2gapk",1,0,"/r/politics","California's court system generally serves as the archetype for state and federal courts across the nation. The California Supreme Court ruled over a century ago that instructing juries that a defendant had a duty to retreat before being justified in the use of self-defense was a violation of a citizen's civil right to self-defense. Since then, many other states have followed suit, overturning laws requiring a duty to retreat.

Also, California's stand-your-ground right applies in public and has nothing to do with castle doctrine. When in your home, Californians have the statutory rights to shoot any non-resident who forcibly enters the home or attempts to enter.

Also, you are wrong about Oregon.  In 2007, in *Oregon v. Sandoval*, Oregon's courts followed California and ruled that the duty to retreat was unconstitutional. Juries in Oregon cannot be instructed that someone had a duty to retreat in a self-defense case.

In fact, most states have followed California in either overturning duty to retreat language in the courts or in passing civil rights legislation confirming the human right to stand your ground and not retreat. Only a handful of states, mostly in the New England area, still have a duty to retreat. I believe it's maybe less than a dozen that still have a duty to retreat."

https://www.transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/USTS-Full-Report-FINAL.PDF

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Trans Women (MTF) make up only 32% of the total transgender population. The rest are Trans Men, Non-binary, etc. (p.44)
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Out of the Surveyed Trans Women, only 68% have already transitioned. The rest are either still questioning or planning on transitioning some day. (p.47)
‚Ä¢	‚Å†53% of trans women ""sometimes or always"" avoid public restrooms (p.228)

Let's assume that the trans women who have already transitioned but never avoid public restrooms are using women's restrooms on a regular basis.

1.4 million * 32% * 68% * 47% = ~143,181 trans women using the women's restrooms on a regular basis.

143,181 trans women / 4100 Senators = 34.9 times as many trans women regularly using the women's restrooms as there have ever been Senators

Let's also remember that ""Trans woman committing sexual assault in a restroom"" is also an incredibly rare crime. Let's highball the number and say that a dozen instances of this crime have occurred (I'd be surprised if it was even half that, though).

Also, to make things easier, I'm going to count all 12,415 people who have ever served in Congress including the House and the Senate, plus the 18 presidents who have never served in Congress. So 12,433 in total

Source: https://history.house.gov/Institution/Total-Members/Total-Members/#:~:text=Since%20the%20U.S.%20Congress%20convened,with%20service%20in%20both%20chambers.

Let's look at the Wikipedia list of Federal Political Sex Scandals. While not all political sex scandals were cases of sexual assault perse, let's assume that the amount of politicans who are serial offenders (Donald Trump for example) and the amount of unrecorded cases of federal politicians committing sexual assault makes up that.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_federal_political_sex_scandals_in_the_United_States

92 according to this page. I know it's not a perfect number, but the true number would be impossible to obtain so this is the closest I think we can get.

12 highball estimate for bathroom sexual assault / 143,181 trans women =

A trans woman using the women's restroom on a regular basis has, at maximum, a 0.008381% chance of ever committing sexual assault in a women's restroom

92 federal political sex scandals / 12,433 federal politicians =

A Senator, House Member, or President has a 0.74% chance of having a federal political sex scandal, and we're assuming that the total amount of sex assault in this demographic is more or less the same as that number.

(Thinking about it, this might even be a low-ball estimate)

**Meaning Members of Congress and Presidents are approx. 88 times more dangerous than trans women in restrooms.**"

With compound interest, the balance goes up because you're paying interest *on* unpaid interest.

So if my loan is $500 and I have $30 in interest but only pay $20, I now owe $510 - but only the original $500 is accruing interest.

Firstly, because they didn't agree to 2% yet. They agreed to raise spending to 2% by 2024. Plenty are on track to meet that target. It's unlikely they'll be reducing spending any time soon. Germany may fail to meet that target, but in 2014 they spent $30 billion on their military. In 2021 that number grew to over $50 billion. Sure, that may not be enough, but it's clear they are actually doing something about it. You can't just triple spending from one day to the next.

Secondly, the US spends just over 3% of GDP on the military. But that helps pay for a global presence. NATO is only a part of what the US military does, whereas that's not the case for many European NATO allies. You're comparing apples with oranges.

Lastly, direct US expenses on defence in Europe are estimated to range between $30-35 billion in 2018. That's roughly 5 - 6% of the total US budget. European NATO allies spent roughly $240 billion, and a lot of that money was spent buying US military tech and systems. I wouldn't be surprised that if you actually crunched the numbers, and included money made from weapons exports to European allies, the US actually makes a small profit off of NATO.

Of course, explaining this to voters takes time, and rational arguments rarely work against opinions based on emotion. Which is what the Russians and Chinese are counting on.

Resulting in idiots coming to the conclusion that the US is better off not being allied to NATO allies with a combined defense budget of a quarter of a trillion dollars, or having access to military bases and airports across the continent and globe."

While you're not entirely wrong, words have different definitions depending on the context they're used, Sin is almost exclusively used to depict an act of transgression against Divine Law, and is usually meant to mean a transgression against a God(s).

Divine Laws and Moral Laws are entirely different, even though Religion is mainly an early form of societal construct. It's hard for an Athiest to say he has sinned because, by his own belief, he does not accept the assertion of a God or the ""Divine"", ergo it would be a bizarre use of the word."

But this wont get the kids out (Need I remind you of how Bernie Sanders was left like a kid waiting on a date at the Prom that never shows up on SUPER TUESDAY??  He was sure that they would come out in droves, but they skipped it).

X, Y, and Millennials:  GET EVERYONE YOU KNOW TO VOTE in 2022 and START RUNNING YOUNGER CANDIDATES THAT HAVE YOUR VALUES.  Sure you have to vote for grandpa in this election, but if we can vote in 2024 YOU can have your people running.  BUT IF YOU DONT VOTE in 2022 you wont get to VOTE again.

b. Tell and do: Legalize Marijuana, and expunge non Violent Pot offenses if we can get the House and Senate. 

c. Forgive $10,000 of Federal Student debt (I know a lot of you will want to down vote this because you want more, but I do not believe more than that will happen.), or set all Federal Student Loan debt interest  0.  

AND FORGIVE ANY DEBT OF ANY ACTIVE MEDICAL PERSONNEL. If anyone deserves it it is the fine Men and Women walking into that BURNING BUILDING every day. 

They will have to reform the entire industries of Universities and Loans because you can't just forgive people now and let the system keep running because the institutions will up their prices betting on another Government Payout to cancel their student loan debt.

This will be a HUGE financial hit for the US economy (Once again, before you down vote go 'do your research' about debt backed investments.  2008 happened because you use bankruptcy to get out of your house debt and that house of cards collapsed.  The Student Loan backed ones CANNOT be discharged by bankruptcy, only death (some get Public Student Loan Forgiveness, but they make it so hard and make a misplaced comma void your entire paperwork) so they are an attractive 'security' investment.)

If the Dems could just get all the House and Senate we could get some real stuff done and right this ship.  Using a few carrots on sticks like legalizing POT (I dont use it, but it SMELLS like everyone else does) and some form of Student Debt reform.

""Last night, Putin recognised the independence of the two regions.

Today he exerted that these regions extend deeper than the ones he's currently recognised as independent.

If you listen up to his speech last night, he's setting up to go much further than these territories.

Who in God's name does Putin think that he has the right to declare countries. This warrants a firm response from the other countries.

I told Putin a month ago, that we would act.

Today, I'm announcing the first tranche of action, closely coordinated with our allies and partner. The sanctions will target FIB and their military bank. We will cut off Russian Government from Western finances, so that they cannot trade its debt at Western market. We will also impose sanctions on the oligarchs profiting from this corrupt system

We worked with Germany to ensure that Nordstream II will not move forward.

**If Russia continues, our sanctions will increase. USA will provide additional equipment to Ukraine, and to strengthen our Baltic allies. This is a defensive motive - we will defend every inch of NATO territory.**

I hope I'm wrong that Russia will invade Ukraine, including Kyiv. Russia has Ukraine surrounded, form the North to Kyiv. Russia has amphibious ships in the Black sea and blood banks at the borders.

**You don't need blood unless you're planning a war.**

Last week, you have seen the Russian playbook Blinken laid out played out - you've seen the Russian Security Council meeting, and the recognition of the Independence. And now Russian ? has voted to send Russian military to Ukraine. This sets the stage for further pretext.

None of us should be fooled. If Russia proceed, it's Russia and Russia alone that bears responsibility.

We stand ready to protect American businesses and consumers. We are making sure that the price of our sanctions is paid by Russian economy, not ours. I wanna limit the pain of the American people at the gas pump - that's important to me.

I met with the German chancellor, Harris met with Zelensky last week. We stand united with our allies against the Russian threat that Russia is making

La**st night, the entire world heard clearly Putin's vision - nothing in his remarks indicates that he's willing to negotiate. He threatened countries that are now thriving democracies and NATO members.**

>Conservatives are arguing that a person should use the restroom associated with the gender of their birth. Seems straight forward enough but history tells us it won't end there.

I think you‚Äôve got a great point about conservatives loving to hyper-focus on one aspect of something as a sort of wedge issue, but i can‚Äôt say I agree with this example.

Banning trans people from using the appropriate bathroom isn‚Äôt ‚Äústraightforward enough.‚Äù  It‚Äôs humiliating and dangerous for the trans person involved.

Worse, it is fundamentally unenforceable unless you‚Äôre willing to implement extraordinarily draconian laws that will affect everyone.  How do you decide who needs to prove their assigned sex at birth in the first place?  Just eyeball things and if a woman looks too butch you harass them?  Is this a thing we let cops do now?  

Even worse than that, ID and appearance alone will not do the trick, you‚Äôd need outright genital checks to be sure you aren‚Äôt just harassing a cis person(and even then SRS exists).

These are not straightforward or reasonable laws in any way.  They are already the ‚Äúone step farther‚Äù you correctly identify they‚Äôll take.

A better example of the ‚Äúincremental debate‚Äù you describe, I think, is trans inclusion in sports.  That‚Äôs an area that is hard for many people to understand, and deserves a nuanced approach depending on the sport; which makes it pretty perfect for whipping people into a transphobic frenzy over.  It‚Äôs also an extraordinarily minor aspect of trans rights that affects very few people, and has no right being as big of a deal as it has been made out to be.

But once anti-trans laws and policies in that area get laid down, they become the justification for future and more serious laws/policies like the bathroom issue.  ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt even let them play sports together because of strength discrepancies, can you imagine letting them use the same bathroom?‚Äù"

Yep, 17 is young and inexperienced.  But most of these kids have parents and other adults that are not 17 to advise them.  There is still some level of accountability to be born by the folks who take out a loan.  Otherwise we are setting up for failure in a different way.

Regarding the banks comparison, yes i know.  I am not comparing the current folks with student loans to banks in 2008 from a knowledge or ethics pov.  Just the concept of setting up a moral hazard in general.  For the long term, we can't set up a situation of excusing student loan debt with no system or parameters in place.  If people know they can fall back on ""well I was 17"" as the reason, it's just gonna cause some of the same young inexperienced people to take out large loans against private colleges and universities for exorbitant amounts.

""And so you're not okay with forgiveness, but you're okay with forgiveness after X amount of time?""
Yes I am.  If your income is above a certain level you should be able to make an effort to repay at a reasonable level (5% of income?) for at least some period of time.  If your income is below some threshold, you don't pay.

Yes very true about the political prospects of ever getting a real solution in place.  But that should not dissuade a conversation about what a reasonable system would look like.

Forgiveness of loans is a start yes but what about my other points?  The money is not free.  50% of folks never go to college.  Are we asking them to help foot that bill?  Who pays for the forgiven loans?  Maybe there is some other funding mechanism to handle that funding.  Increase taxes in higher brackets.  One time tax charge or something.

Do we forgive debt for technical and trade schools as well?  What about for folks who took out loans to attend shady for-profit institutions that any reasonable adult should be able to tell is a bad deal?

As I was trying to convey in my last paragraph in the op, the press is often doing a lousy job reporting on this issue.  Obviously something's gotta give.  But developing a consensus around a better system for the future starts with reporting on other better options, interviewing folks with ideas about what that might look like, etc.  But instead the press mostly wants to focus on the most emotional political back and forth that gets clicks."

Even if you think interest is unfair/predatory, no one is REQUIRED to pay 3k/mo on a 40k loan.  Its not even worth using that as a case for why forgiveness is necessary.
 
40k loan @ 9% is a payment of 507/mo over 10 years. If you pay 3k/mo then it's paid off in a year.  

I paid 35k off in a year and a half making 40k/yr.  Like I said, I didn't pay rent for that year and a half, but even if I did, it would only have delayed my paying it off by a couple of years.

You know what people should do about the 60 senator issue?  Get out and vote.  I voted for Bernie and donated to him every month.  When he didn't win the primary, I supported Biden.  I went out and voted, because I'm an adult and Trump is/was horrible.  Millenials/younger voters outnumber the Boomers, but our turnout is fucking garbage.  Our age cohort must not care all that much about the issues if they dont even show up.

Everyone who grew cannabis before legalization knew this was going to happen... They even proposed a lesser tax schedule to lawmakers. They didn't listen and now California is battling grey market sales and cultivation. 

Lesson learned:. Don't be like California Democrats. Don't be like Democrats at all. Legalize cannabis, tax it MODERATELY AND CONSERVATIVELY. Democrats see any and all business as nothing more than tax potential and they wonder why business owners go running to Republicans.

Telling a white supremacist they have an advantage over you doesn't cause them to give up their advantage. Just the opposite. They press it or try to justify its existence.

Do you have time to volunteer on election day?  Check with your Board of Elections and volunteer to be a poll worker.  Many of these volunteers tend to be on the older and with Covid still rampant, they are more at risk.  There is always a shortage of volunteers.

Does your vote ""not count"" because you in the minority?  If you live in a DEEP red state, your vote is still important but there is still more you can do.  Volunteer for campaigns in more contested races.  Every single campaign needs volunteers and many of them allow you to volunteer remotely.

He was great on free trade, he was a calm voice when we needed it, and his income tax cuts were way more equitable than other Republicans, so much so that Obama was able to make them permanent.

"17851",7235,"hy45gcn",1,0,"/r/politics","Trump had a lot of promises he never kept.

Said he would leave Afghanistan... instead just months before he would leave office helped release all the Taliban soldiers and said ""next presidents problem.""  


Would Russia invade Ukraine if Trump was president... Who knows... but I doubt he would've done anything to stop them. Hell they probably started this years ago thinking Trump would still be president. Trump didn't stop or say anything about Russia invading Ukraine's eastern boarders to support separatists during his entire presidency."
"17861",7236,"hy4ccrn",1,0,"/r/politics","Donald Trump has been a Russian asset for years, even prior to being elected as POTUS, he laundered Russian money. Obama slapped heavy-ass sanctions on Russia that deeply affected Putin's circle of oligarchs (thus partly why Trump despises Obama specifically).

Trump brought on Manafort to launder more money for Russia through the NRA / DB and feed the Trump and GOP pocket book after his campaign went belly up. Putin paid Manafort, Putin paid Giuliani's Ukraine trip to get dirt on Bidens. Rudy got the ambassador to Ukraine fired.

Trump was afraid of the Mueller investigation because.. obviously.. so he brought in Barr. Meanwhile he sued up to the SCOTUS to block access to DB records. Barr also protected Rudy.

That's before we even get into the tie between DB and SCOTUS justice Kennedy, or Trump's push to allow Crimea to be Putin's so he could build his hotel in Yalta, or even Trump's push to weaken sanctions on Russia - that Republicans had to codify in order to prevent.

If you don't believe at this point that Trump is an asset owned by Russia, you need to re-evaluate all the things you think couldn't be possible.

I agree that Biden and the Democrat ""leadership"" (and I'm using the term as loosely as humanly possible here) are focusing their efforts on swing voters, as they always do, and it's just not a functional strategy anymore if it ever was. 

The GOP panders to their base 24/7, and their base turns out for every election no matter how minor as though it's Superbowl Christmas. This occurs even though once in office the GOP enacts policies that directly damage their base. Their voters just don't care.

Meanwhile the Democrats ALSO pander to the GOP base 24/7, accomplishing less than nothing because these people are convinced that we're literally Satan. Simultaneously the Democrats issue condescending lectures to their own base about how silly we are for expecting them to adhere to their party platform or keep campaign promises. Consequently in a turn of events that SHOULD surprise no one but somehow manages to surprise the Democrats every single goddamned time, their base doesn't show up in significant numbers for anything but the biggest elections.

Every election we've lost or won in a nailbiter for the last twenty years should have been a wakeup call for the Democrats to stop chasing imaginary swing voters and focus on getting their own base to show up for elections. Instead they just keep thinking Lucy is going to let them kick the football this time and we're just one more election away from Republican voters deserting the GOP in droves and coming over to our side.

"18141",7264,"hy29d3j",1,0,"/r/politics","Going over the article there isn‚Äôt enough depth on payday loans, I believe, to give a proper context for urgency in this matter. 

We had a law firm client who was active fighting payday loan operations and i got a full briefing one afternoon on their practices, they are a hideously parasitic legal extortion and how they can be legal to own and run is beyond me. 

You have to keep in mind no one needs to use one of these places unless you need to and those are vulnerable people. They do use them and many cases without issues. But when you‚Äôre vulnerable that also means to all obligations including one of these payday operators who do exactly what a loan shark does in respect to internet rate penalties and more. Should something happen that you didn‚Äôt make your payment, you‚Äôve set the trap. Once you‚Äôve set the trap, there‚Äôs only one way and it‚Äôs a financial penalty spiral that sees these people paying far far far more than the principle amount. Way more. 

The fact that these disgusting business can continue and donate to Americas political system is frightening. These parasites need a population of poor people. Politicians in the US are very happy to keep that the status quo here. To me this is an overt display of greed and power showing society and class structuring by our very own leaders."

"19471",7397,"hy3y0vp",4,0,"/r/politics","Putin s Russia is 100% what Republicans want. They don't want their supporters to think that Democracy is real so you might as well vote for the bad guy because he pisses off the other side. There is a big gap between the Russian People and the Oligarchs and Putin. The people get wrapped up in culture wars and that keeps them from looking at the thieves behind the curtain stuffing their pockets with anything and everything of value.

The question is if the Russian Kleptocracy is sustainable. The Republicans in the US want to see, without any intervention, if the people of Russia will fall in line with Putin. If he can take Ukraine and survive then that is what the Republicans will adopt as their mission.

The one thing a super wealthy person in the US can't be at this time is as wealthy as a Russian Oligarch."

This is the advantage dictators have. They can silence their critics and act fast. Putin took advantage of this. Unless he really fucks up it's going to be Crimea 2.0

But with nukes still on the board, this is the game we have to play.

We either commit political suicide and hand the country to the party who has been incredibly cozy with the Russians or we work within our constraints and maybe try to hold off the GOP until Putin backs off again to let international relations cool off before he does it again"

In regards to Fox being an entertainment channel, it's a clever defense to not get sued. Crony capitalism permeates both parties. The philosophy of the right that I agree with is for lesser govt (which unfortunately allows for greedy corporations to have greater power) but in turn allows individuals, like you and I, to have more freedom. The philosophy of the left that I disagree with is for more govt (which we not only lose our freedoms, but also gives the illusion that govt will keep big corporations in check) but in reality gives career politicians more leverage in who they work for. 
There's a chart on vox, I'm sure you probably seen it, about how our votes don't really matter. And how the big monies interests that pay congress sway their decisions much greater than our votes do. Knowing this, how can you trust bigger govt to champion what the people want? They (the govt) will just trample over us."

I certainly won't deny that unregulated prostitution is riddled with abuse (pimps are notorious psychopaths), something I think can be largely solved by legalizing and regulating prostitution. But we punish the victims (I know Johns are also punished here, but it's pretty fucked we punish the women at all). 

I read a few years ago that in Scandinavia, it's illegal to be a john, but not to be a hooker. That is very fair imo

EDIT: sorry a comment below reminded me to specify, they have legal prostitution that's regulated and it's assured that all parties are consensual, safe, 18+, etc. It's only illegal to pay for the services of an underground prostitute, who's very likely trafficked/coerced/underaged/etc"

There is some sort of false entitlement where owners (want us to) believe that new stadiums will revitalize the local economy so the locals should help pay.

Well, the owners and the stadium would fail if there were no customers. The customers are contributing to the new stadium by buying their products and services, which come at a premium etc.. Their role in the equation shouldn't also be to fund the cost to build. Unless they are getting some sort of revenue sharing.

It's like a new McDonald's opening up and asking the neighboring businesses and residents to pony up for the cost of build out.

Or like paying poverty wages, so the government has to support the McDonald's by giving the underpaid employees food stamps.

This nonsense happens everywhere in our society.

Idk if they have actually formed those thoughts in their own heads, but I have a hard time believing that a chunk of these people don‚Äôt have a sense of it being wrong. Maybe I put too much faith in humans. The psychology of people who feel like they are losing something that is merely subjective but is perceived as important to their continued security is beyond my comprehension as someone who is always open to changing my position based on evidence. It‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt look at the world and see how improperly balanced on the cliff‚Äôs edge it is, but I try to remain calm and think it through rationally and try to figure out what the best approach would be to balancing civilization.

"22221",7672,"hy3xyo6",1,0,"/r/politics","I think there is more to it than that but at some level this is a big part of it.  I suggest checking out Michael Sandel's book - The Tryanny of Merit or if easier, listen to some of the podcasts he has been on discussing the book.

He makes an interesting argument that I find pretty compelling and seems to explain at least some of the resentment politics we see growing now, especially among the right.  

We are placed in a society where those who are not educated are often not seen as valued.   We place high value on those that get highly educated but the flip side of this is low value gets placed on those that are not.  Those that do well are seen as fully deserving of that success with the implication being that those that do not do well are also fully deserving of that non-success.

Then comes along a leader who panders to those non-elites by suggesting it is the fault of others for their lack of success.  Usually the arguments are ones we all have heard -  It is the fault of immigrants, it is the fault of liberal elites, etc...

The ideal solution would be to shift the notion of value in society and increase the baseline dignity across all groups in society. Granted this is likely very hard because those that are well educated and successful are generally not willing to accept a shift in values either as it would come with a concession that they are where they are mostly due to luck - otherwise there would be no argument for a shift (if you feel you ""deserve"" your success and it is not due to mostly luck, you will not want to shift these notions).

So instead, a populist like Trump comes along and panders to that resentment.  We can say that Trump sounds like an uneducated idiot, so the uneducated will follow him but it goes deeper than that.  I think it is also the case he also gives them a sense of value and dignity that they aren't getting from the rest of society that makes them feel unvalued."

At this point, it's probably all but inevitable that the world is in for a rough decade, but until then, I  think in the US we can hit the ""lost"", as it were, from two directions:

1. We individually search around for the weakest- minded ones and pick them off one at a time to bring them back into the fold of love.

2. We speak with our dollars. We stop purchasing from the states with the most egregious offenders pushing their will and propaganda on the people (Texas and Florida especially). We stop supporting the ones who support them. We don't fight them, we just don't invite them to the party anymore. 

Overall, I think it would be a good idea to stop consuming as much as possible for a while. We need food, but not much else. The loans our overlords took out on us won't last long without us. It'll require some sacrifice and hardship, but the payoff is worth it"

"22271",7677,"hy3vybu",1,0,"/r/politics","Most of those issues, except for maybe healthcare, aren't what truly drive voters.

Voters might be *okay* with Marijuana legalization, some level of student debt forgiveness (and I'm not even convinced of this yet), sex work decriminalization, etc, but that doesn't *drive them* to the polls. 

What drives the average voter to the poll are issues democrats are currently struggling with -- inflation, COVID policies at schools, in-person schooling, a rise in violent crime and theft and healthcare. I think Dems are the party best equipped to handle most of these, but Dems have done themselves no favors being soft of crime and making it harder to return to school."

I wouldn‚Äôt say it cost him the election, but it absolutely cost him votes amongst the only important demographic, the swing voters.  Making it standard procedure to stack the court is a precedent that will work primarily against progressive policies because as we‚Äôve seen with abortion, legislators can work much faster than a court that has to wait for cases to go through the system and work their way up to it.

First is one that you hear a lot and that is the fact that while people did sign up for these loans, they did so under significant pressure (17 and 18 year olds who were told their whole life that a college degree was essential to the future) and were told very optimistic things about the job market which awaited them, which projections spectacularly failed to live up to.  In many cases, you have people who are still only able to make the minimum payments as the economy has remained unfavorable for a very long time, and as a result, they have paid a significant amount of money, but most of it continues to go to interest with a large principal (which continues to generate ever more interest).

Secondly, is the benefit in the much broader sense, in the current economy where we as a society need more people spending money and at least doing some investing (whether in retirement funds, stocks, a home, or any other form of property).  Money spent on repaying loans, especially money going towards the interest on a loan, is dead money.  That kind of money does little to stimulate the economy.  Large lenders primarily return their profits to investors, without movement of goods or services really.  Money spent on interest payments is money not able to be spent in stores or for property.

So even if it isn't 'fair', it is in all of our collective best interest to have more people in the economy with more extra money to spend on things that will actually grown the economy."

"24641",7914,"hy2n5w7",4,0,"/r/politics","So, I'm on the other side. I generally believe in the right to self defense, however, I do believe that there is a duty to attempt to retreat except where castle doctrine is in play. There are situations where it is reasonable to believe that an invasion of one's place of residence or retreat is a threat to body and life. I am against public stand your ground laws on the grounds that upon entering the agora, your right to defend yourself is necessarily impinged upon by the rights of the collective to a space free of violence except where that peace has already been demonstrably and without a doubt terminated.

Unfortunately, and here's the problem:

Even if the data proved beyond a reasonable doubt a causation, the American South (my home) has a dire problem of malice, misanthropy, and mistrust.  There are a wide audience of people like me, who believe in the right to self defense who unlike me, argue that this means that there are homicides that are not only not criminal, but that they are right.

To put it another way: To many supporters of stand your ground laws, the additional homicides, if undeniably proven to be caused by the implementation of stand your ground laws, are not just acceptable, they are desired, as the American South has become so misanthropic that it believes that those who will die due to this largely deserve death. The widespread availability of firearms in the US puts us in a unique position as a nation where we tacitly accept homicide as a necessary consequence of the right to individual bodily autonomy... And that's a big social problem.

I don't believe that these numbers demonstrate adequately that stand your ground laws increase homicide rates upon implementation, but I do believe that they do demonstrate that they do not decrease homicides upon implementation: The justification that they make people safer in their person or their homes cannot be rationally supported.

The question you have to ask yourself ultimately, is who you are arguing deserves to live, and who deserves to die, and whether stand your ground laws are effective at sorting those parties out. --For a multitude of reasons, I do not believe that this is the case. It merely aids in ensuring that a homicide is less likely to be seen as a crime, which in some cases might be justice, and in others, may not be."

It‚Äôs also worth noting that the percentage of people who de-transition is only about 2%, and the number one reason for it is that they‚Äôre getting bullied for being trans. It‚Äôs *very* rare to transition and then realize you aren‚Äôt actually trans.

Meanwhile over 40% of trans people will attempt suicide at some point, with the number one reason being (once again) lack of support for their transition. But study after study has shown that the suicide rate amongst trans people drops to being the same as it is for everyone else when they‚Äôre allowed to transition and accepted by their community.

The most effective time to stop a pandemic is in the early stages when you have the possibility to isolate and quarantine patients. For you to totally disregard the timing and the fact that Trump inherited a virus free nation, while Biden took office in the midst of a raging pandemic is disingenuous. See any difference? Or maybe you thought the Great Recession was Obama's fault, because he took office just as the crisis took hold.  
Don't just throw out a generic phrase like ""the numbers"" without giving it context.   
First, let's recognize that the pandemic didn't even begin in the US until March 2020, so I guess you'd like to give Trump an A+ for his early handling of the virus in January and February, for having zero deaths due to Covid, because, yes, there was no Covid then. When the virus did begin to take hold, cases and the deaths that followed were slow to rise, because that's how pandemic's spread. So, again, let's give credit to Trump for doing nothing, which enabled the virus to take hold and become uncontrollable. (/s)  
And again, if the numbers were worse once the vaccines became available, that certainly wasn't attributable to a failing of the vaccines, but due to vaccine hesitance, largely from the right politicizing it, largely by Republican pols. My original statement about leading conservatives to the vaccine is validated by the numbers in every credible scientific study you'd care to cite. Here's one article that puts the numbers into perspective: [COVID: Who is not vaccinated and what's the risk?](https://www.bbc.com/news/59757395)

So revue that and admit, it's largely the unvaccinated who are responsible for more deaths in 2021 vs 2020, meaning, not Biden's fault, because lord knows, he did everything he could to mandate the vaccine and caught all kinds of shit for it, but he was right.

In my opinion, the article is very misleading, edging into false. 
Here‚Äôs why: for a [rogue, dictatorial] president/man (Putin) who is on a seemingly expansionist agenda, this is a way to annex more land without really going into war. The two breakaway regions he recognized as independent, though Ukrainian territory, support Russia. In doing recognizing them as independent, it gave him the leeway he needed to station Russian troops there. And there being no strong enough deterrence to stop him, he gets the land. Blood free (at least for the time being) and at very low cost in every kind of way. 

So yes, it is genius. A very well calculated genius move on Putin‚Äôs part.

That's the point. They'd be able to actually invest in something that builds them long-term and familial wealth. They'd actually be able to start families without worry of not being able to provide.

My point is that it's a two-pronged problem that requires 2 things to solve it. The cancellation of student debt, even if it's just a portion of it, and an expansion of public funding to include at least an associate's degree to make it free at the point of service. That way, once at least an associate's is obtained,  newly graduated individuals can actually start their lives. They can buy a house, they can start a family. Of course that's gonna be debt on them, but it's for an investment they can actually pass on to the next generation. You can't pass your years of education to your next of kin. But you can pass a house to them. And in this country, what you own is everything. A house is always viewed as a sound investment because it's viewed as a sign of upward mobility.

> You say that $300/mo isn't ""that much"", but it can be all the difference.

Trust me, I understand it can make a difference. I've lived very frugally because I have to. So any amount extra is helpful. But I shouldn't have to live that frugally. No one should have to live like that. That extra $$ should just be a given since the gap between a HS diploma and an associates degree isn't that large despite the cost associated with the associate's degree. 

The point I was trying to make was that that $300 isn't enough to make a **substantial** difference in a person's life. I've lived that difference, I know firsthand. That extra $300 isn't going to lift the burdens anyone has. Sure I might feel a bit of relief, but it isn't going to make any substantial difference.

> For a few years now, the leaders of the Republican Party have pretty steadfastly avoided outlining anything amounting to an actual party agenda. The 2020 Republican platform was merely a (somewhat awkward) repeat of its 2016 document, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has pointedly declined to state in advance what he would do with a Senate majority after the 2022 election. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you know when we take it back,‚Äù McConnell has said.
> 
> The posture certainly reinforces that the GOP has come to be defined more by one man (Donald Trump) and his accompanying political ethos than by a consistent set of ideals. But it also serves a rather evident purpose: to avoid pinning the party down on specifics that might become liabilities at some point ‚Äî particularly as its principles have shifted markedly in recent years.
> 
> All of which Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) has now reinforced.
> 
> Scott, the head of Senate Republicans‚Äô campaign arm, has responded to McConnell‚Äôs lack of an agenda with an agenda of his own. While stressing that it‚Äôs his own product and not affiliated with the National Republican Senatorial Committee, Scott is a GOP leader and a potential future presidential candidate. Thus, it carries some weight.
> 
> And while many have focused on what the agenda says about culture-war issues such as transgender rights, one of the most striking and evocative parts is what it says about taxes. The 11-point plan calls for new taxes on tens of millions of Americans, by rekindling the same issue that led Mitt Romney to stumble into his ‚Äú47 percent‚Äù gaffe.
> 
> ‚ÄúAll Americans should pay some income tax to have skin in the game, even if a small amount,‚Äù the plan says. ‚ÄúCurrently over half of Americans pay no income tax.‚Äù
> 
> The language of the plan itself effectively acknowledges it‚Äôs advocating for an income tax increase on ‚Äúover half of Americans‚Äù ‚Äî a group of people that is overwhelmingly lower-income. And in fact, the number of Americans to whom this would apply has climbed during the pandemic.
> 
> While Romney overly simplistically referred to 47 percent of people who both paid no income tax and voted for Democrats because of it, the number who paid no income tax was indeed around half. In 2020, though, that number climbed as high as 61 percent, according to the Tax Foundation.
> 
> You begin to see the potential political problem here. Scott‚Äôs document doesn‚Äôt discuss the issue in as ham-handed a way as Romney did in that infamous video ‚Äî though suggesting those who don‚Äôt pay income taxes don‚Äôt have ‚Äúskin in the game‚Äù is certainly dicey. But it does advocate for raising taxes on, in the Tax Foundation‚Äôs estimate, as many as 75 million people who paid no such taxes after deductions and credits in 2020. If you include the 32 million who didn‚Äôt file returns, such as retirees, the number climbs well over 100 million Americans. (Scott‚Äôs plan isn‚Äôt explicit on whether his idea would include such people, but it does say ‚Äúall Americans.‚Äù)
> 
> The political ads almost write themselves: The leader of the effort to elect a Senate majority wants to use that to raise taxes on as much as half of the country, however modestly. The GOP has for years defined virtually any new tax as a tax increase, and this meets that definition.
> 
> The move is also particularly interesting because it‚Äôs far out of step with how at least one prominent Republican tackled this issue during the Trump era. As NBC‚Äôs Benjy Sarlin wrote a year ago, Trump effectively said people not having to pay income taxes was something to be celebrated. He proposed codifying a zero percent income tax rate for those making $25,000 per year individually or $50,000 as a married couple ‚Äî rather than those people merely getting to zero through deductions. He even floated sending those people tax returns that stated, ‚ÄúI win.‚Äù Trump proudly projected his plan would increase the number of Americans who didn‚Äôt pay income tax to 75 million.
> 
> Precisely why this was included in Scott‚Äôs agenda is an interesting question ‚Äî both given how it contrasts with Trump‚Äôs tax vision and because of the headaches it could cause the party. For now, though, much like Romney‚Äôs 47 percent comment, it‚Äôs going to force some measure of accounting. That would start, it would seem, with McConnell and the candidates whose election to the Senate Scott is in charge of leading.
> 
> At the very least, it would seem a good opportunity to start talking about what the GOP would actually do with that Senate majority.

Raise Taxes on 75-100 Million Americans. What Master Politicians.

Of course, it will get a fraction of attention compared to some made-up cultural war, fabricated on Fox News, to rile up, millions of those 75-100 Million, to vote for the GOP.

Edit: Also if there's something deserving of valid criticism in politics, then I'm all for it being criticised by the media, regardless of sides. This isn't a sports team where you have to be a die-hard fan for your 'team'. Politicians should be serving the people and if they do something that's hurtful to the average person then they should be called out for it. They should all be held accountable for their actions in a position of power. And there is typically news reported on all of it.

**sexual assault** in the one semester he spent in college (at one of the most ultra conservative college in America) before dropping out due to having straight Ds (his own admission), he was accused of sexual assault by a dozen women, in a letter signed by over 150 former classmates who corroborated the victim‚Äôs accounts, which represents almost 50% of the entire student body of Patrick Henry College. It was so bad and brazen that RAs and staff would warn female students to never be alone with him, and never get in his car. Source: https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/addybaird/madison-cawthorn-sexual-misconduct-allegations-patrick

**white supremacy** he accused a political opponent of ‚Äúleaving his career in Boston to go work for non-whites‚Äù. Like, he wrote that, on his website, as an insult. As a way to discredit someone. He later said the words were ‚Äútaken out of context‚Äù and it was a ‚Äúsyntax error‚Äù. The name of his shell company is ‚ÄúSPQR Holdings‚Äù, and SPQR, although a historical acronym with Roman roots, has been appropriated by white supremacist groups in recent years. sources: https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/republican-house-candidate-s-website-attacks-critic-going-work-non-n1244531

**lying about Paralympics training** he lied about training for the olympics by pretending he was actually on the verge of cracking the track and field Paralympic team. He posted all these insane videos where he talks about being obsessed with breaking the 100m world record, like he actually has a chance of breaking it.

**lying about his career** he has never held a job in his adult life (he worked at a Chick-Fil-A as a teen). He used the insurance payout from his car accident to buy a $20K foreclosed property in Georgia, registered an LLC with 0 employees and $0 top line revenue, and calls himself a ‚Äúreal estate investor‚Äù.

**Lying about his car accident** He lied in interviews and said he heroically crawled out of a fiery crash and that friend in the car with him left him for dead when in fact his friend dragged him out while he was unconscious. The friend in question has since done many interviews sharing his side of the story. Source: https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/entry/madison-crowther-lies-wheelchair_n_603c5e83c5b6d7794ae01026

The main problem that the Republican party is focusing on is inflation, how the rest of the world views the US, and finally (probably the most important one) we take serious issue with other people forcing your values on others.

Section Three of the Fourteenth Amendment disqualifies an individual from serving as a state or federal official if that person has ""engaged in insurrection or rebellion against"" the United States. This includes the funding, instigating, promoting, or facilitating in an insurrection. It was a clause written within the context of the Civil War but was also included to theoretically apply for members of future rebellions or insurrections against the United States. 
  

  
*A person who through prompting causes a lawless act is guilty of that act.* 
  

  
""Imminent lawless action"" is a standard currently used that was established by the United States Supreme Court in Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969) It defined the limits of freedom of speech. Brandenburg clarified what constituted a ""clear and present danger"", the standard established by Schenck v. United States (1919). 
  

  
This Supreme Court Ruling firmly established that speech that merely advocated violence could be illegal. Under the imminent lawless action test, speech is not protected by the First Amendment if the speaker intends to incite a violation of the law that is both imminent and likely. 
  

  
**Cawthorn** who spoke at the pre-attack rally, is quoted as saying if elections ‚Äúare stolen,‚Äù it will ‚Äúlead to one place, and that‚Äôs bloodshed,‚Äù and added that he is ‚Äúwilling to defend liberty at all costs‚Äù.

We failed on covid for a lot of reasons that have nothing to do with wealth. 

We had a terrible president who undermined the public response at every opportunity and basically instructed his core supporters (about 40% of the population) to ignore restrictions and spread the virus freely. 

Our healthcare system is underfunded (by choice, we have the money but choose not to spend it).

Our government is very decentralized institutionally prevented from acting decisively throughout the country. Where other countries could simply say, ""next Monday, every school in the country is closed"" - the United States had 50 governors fighting their own legislatures, who in turn were fighting city governments and even local school district administrators. 

Meanwhile - outside of our horrible covid response, America is a very rich country. If California, just one of our 50 states, were a country, it would be a larger economy, on its own, than the entire United Kingdom. And that only represents 12 percent of the USA's population.

The US has a MASSIVE gap between the rich and the poor, and that makes us an outlier in both positive and negative ways.

We have the best Universities in the world and routinely out-produce the world in Nobel winners. We have an economy that is very dynamic and routinely births $1 billion global companies seemingly out of thin air.

We also have tremendous poverty and hunger, including among children, ridiculously disparate healthcare and education outcomes by race, and a gun violence problem that nobody else in the so-called ""developed world"" can understand."

I almost find this hard to believe, only because I've literally never met anyone who isnt white who is naive enough to actually believe white Americans are at the bottom of the govt subsidy totem pole. Literally every race neutral govt program is de facto for whites, because whites own the majority of farmland, stocks, businesses and wealth in general. The poorest whites benefit as much as or more than blacks from welfare. And even in explicitly race based policies such as affirmative action, it is often not whites who are disproportionately underserved. When the UC system blinded its applicants in terms of race, the proportion of white students at its flagship schools did not go up, but Asians. In other words, AA is a program designed to give spots from Asian Americans to under represented minorities. I'm not here to debate whether or not the program is meritorious, but the fact remains that whites are absolutely never on the bottom of the totem pole for anything. 

With respect to my personal biases, I would not replace whites with blacks in my statement because I do not feel that way about blacks. Furthermore, I feel that I am able to separate what I think about a group from how I interact with individuals. Frankly I have no choice because white Americans are the large majority of people I interact with daily anyway. So just because I think Americans happen to be conceited, whiny, lazy hypocrites and that American culture happens to be superficial, materialistic, boorish, and anti intellectual, does not mean that I cannot treat friends, colleagues, and patients with dignity and respect until they give me reason to do otherwise. If that makes me a part of the problem or racist in your eyes, I am comfortable with that."

Either compare the proud boys with Oberlin sophomores, or tucker Carlson with Rachel Maddow or MTG with AOC.

The 'culture war' is a one-sided effort by conservatives to ban books and criminalize trans children.  There is no comparable effort.  And again, don't come back with public criticism of professors with ""don't say gay"" laws.  Either compare actual legislation, or non-elected actors on both sides.

Kids just a few years older than them had experienced some of the horror and the terror of wartime - the bombs, the air raid shelters, the gas masks, the rationing, the evacuations etc. They'd seen relatives go off to war and not come back. And then all of a sudden there's these kids who just missed all of that horror and were born into this idyllic post war world. You can imagine the older kids ridiculing them and attacking them for being mollycoddled and sheltered. It caused Boomers to start tough posturing in order to compensate, and then of course they abused and mocked younger people in turn for the same thing. Try and tell a Boomer that kids these days have it tougher than they ever did. They lose the plot."

(Interesting that you'd compare a woman who actively rejected her own education - and disparages the education of others - to a graduate student who leveraged stripping to pay for part of her education.)

>It's a gimmick for rubes. 

I disagree with this, too. I think it's a sad commentary on how our culture harshly judges an industry and the people who work in it.

>You realize she wrote the article and chose her own headline, right?

I agree she likely wrote it. I doubt she did so without input and guidance from her campaign staff, though. Either way, the point's irrelevant.

>""I‚Äôm A Former Stripper Running For Congress."" That's what she wants her first introduction to be, and it's completely irrelevant to her qualifications for Congress.

I sincerely doubt she wants this to be her introduction in the grander sense. Again, I think this was a necessary step to get ahead of irrelevant judgments people would and are leveling against her."

Reality is not simple. It is not black and white.

Telling the truth is difficult, not only because of the complexities, but because there are simply things we do not know.

A common layperson wants to listen to and follow someone who appears resolute and knows exactly what is right/good and what is wrong/bad. The truth is far messier.

Furthermore, the two 'republics' control less than half of the two oblasts, but have claimed independence for the entirety of the Luhansk and Donetsk Oblasts.

Lastly, in those areas of Donetsk and Luhansk which could be polled after the Russian-backed separatists launched their war (so those areas not then under rebel control), an absolute majority were opposed to unification with Russia, and a supermajority were either opposed or undecided.  Obviously there have been referrendums held in the occupied territories which have different results, with questions raised about their accuracy, so it is impossible to have a clear picture.  Additionally, some raion in those oblasts (outside of the occupied areas) have held referrendum which showed support to have their raion moved to one of the neighboring oblasts. So at the very least it calls into question whether the entirety of these two oblasts want independence.

Your comparison to Kosovo or South Korea fall flat, because in those territories, the will of the people was clear.  That is certainly not the case in the Donbass.

I'm absolute terms, a third rate modern power could demolish each those nations at their height. Especially the Romans and Mongolians, who would have no answer for airpower.

Also, in absolute terms, no pre-modern state had the ability to project power globally, for obvious reasons.

In relative terms, each of those nations had peer competitiors that posed a significant threat to them and their interests. For the Romans, the Parthians/Sassanids and the Ethiopian Empire were close by peer competitiors that could (and did!) twart Roman interests. A bit further afield lay the Han Empire and a variety of powers in India, which Rome had neither the logistical capability nor the military power to bring to heel.

For the Mongols, there were the Mamluks, the Vietnamese, the Japanese, and arguably the Hungarians, each of which kept their lands from being added to the Mongolian Empire.

Finally, the British Empire. I'm going to look at the second British Empire at its height, rather than the first British Empire (which was not even the most powerful empire of its day). The second British Empire had at least five rivals: France, Germany, the United States, and Russia, and later Japan, each of which could (and did!) resist the will of the British Empire.

This isn't to say that the above powers weren't incredible and unique, they all were, in different ways. But at no point were they the sole undisputed hyperpower. For a brief bit between the fall of the USSR and 9/11, the United States was.

That's when prosecutors avoid taking on rich and heavily lawyered criminals because they fear the court battles will be hard to win. The problem is, as Comey noted, you lose 100% of the fights you run away from. Trump, who will pay a lawyer ten times what he owes a contractor just to get out of the contract, has exploited chickenshittery in prosecutors his whole life. He is clearly hoping it will save his neck post-coup. 

>But New York's attorney general, Letitia James, has not shared Garland's timidity in the face of Trump's relentless threats of lawsuits and counter-filings. Instead, she's gone hard after Trump and his family, based on the extensive evidence of decades of fraud. So far, her willingness to put up a fight has garnered significant returns. Trump's accounting firm fired him, a sign they see his company as a ship they'd rather not go down with. And last week, a Manhattan judge ruled that Trump and his children must sit for depositions, after a ridiculous hearing in which Trump's lawyers spewed conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton in a pathetic bid to confuse the issue at hand. 

>And despite a lack of support from the DOJ, the January 6 committee has been doing a good job of accruing evidence that Trump's coup was extensive and organized. Plenty of what has been leaked indicates criminal activity Trump could be easily be arrested for either pressuring Georgia's secretary of state into fabricating votes, destroying evidence, or absconding with classified materials. The National Archives has now joined with the January 6 committee into unsubtly and publicly nudging a reluctant DOJ into doing something about this criminal who will absolutely attempt another coup if he's not stopped. And in standing up to Trump, both the National Archives and the January 6 committee show that sometimes victory is possible ‚Äî but only if you actually fight. 

>Maybe the fantasies of so many on Twitter will manifest and the cuffs will suddenly come out for Trump. Likelier, however, is what Brian Beutler of Crooked Media recently wrote of Garland in his newsletter: ""[W]e'd be naive not to wonder how much of his reluctance to enforce the law against prominent right-wing criminals is driven by fear"" of a right-wing backlash. The problem, however, is that ""if crooks can opt out of the criminal law through public intimidation, we should wonder how much they'll ultimately get away with simply by threatening to whip up a public shitstorm if they meet any resistance."""

They recommend the cut even for patients who haven't ended up feeling groggy, and especially in women (who don't metabolize the medication as quickly as men). The recommendations also included a warning to insomnia medications in general:

To decrease the potential risk of impairment with all insomnia drugs, health care professionals should prescribe, and patients should take, the lowest dose capable of treating the patient's insomnia.
As doctors debated the merits of these claims, Ambien made the news again last month when a national study reported that the number of emergency department (E.D.) visits related to adverse reactions from Ambien has risen by almost 220% in 5 years:

The number of zolpidem-related E.D. visits involving adverse reactions increased nearly 220 percent from 2005 to 2010.
Females accounted for two thirds of zolpidem-related E.D. visits involving adverse reactions in 2010. Patients over 65 represented one third.
Half of visits involved patients who had combined other medications with zolpidem, including narcotics, anti-anxiety medications, and other insomnia meds.
The most common complaints in these cases were ""daytime drowsiness, dizziness, hallucinations, agitation, sleep-walking and drowsiness while driving."""

So, they can receive certain treatments (i.e. therapy) to help them to cope and understand what they are feeling.  If needed and at the guidance of therapists, doctors and parents, as a pre-teen they might be prescribed hormone blockers so that they do not go through puberty as the gender they do not associate with, because going through it makes it harder to reverse.  They'd continue that path until becoming an adult, where at 17 or 18 they could then have a gender reassignment surgery... which is, again, typically coupled with therapy and the like.

This interpretation would mean that parents who take their kid to therapy where they help the kid understand and maybe 'promote' their feelings of not being in the right body (and/or later get them hormone blockers by a doctor's prescription) could be found guilty of child abuse and could be prosecuted for such and have that child (and others) removed."
"34301",8880,"hy0wvrj",5,0,"/r/politics","Do not vote for her - please hear me out:

For one, I am not going to continue voting for the two-party duopoly. This ""lesser of two evils"" nonsense is perpetuating the system that we currently live in. The reason Hunt is weak on issues is because she *can* be weak on these issues, and people will still vote for her. Don't give her the opportunity to be weak on the issues like she already is.

Let's get into the issues now:

*""Decriminalizing Sex Work. Criminalizing sex work drives sex work underground, thus compromising sex workers‚Äô health and safety. Although there have been attempts to criminalize the purchase of sex work, the stigma and fear of legal repercussions persist for the workers themselves, disproportionately affecting trans women of color. Alexandra will work to protect sex workers by decriminalizing prostitution and loitering for adults and expunging past convictions.""*

I agree that we should decriminalize sex work, but we should *also* give sex workers certain rights. They should be able to protect their body, privacy and their money. I've heard of men who ask women to do things that go against their initial agreements, and/or they don't even pay.

""*Medicare for All. Alexandra believes healthcare is a human right. In Congress, Alexandra will vote in favor of a single-payer, high quality, national health insurance program and support the passing of Medicare for All. Alexandra will dismantle the current healthcare industry standard, removing networks, premiums, copays, and deductibles. She will fight to cancel all medical debt and to expand every person‚Äôs access to consistent medical care. Medicare should be expanded to cover mental health; dental, vision, home or community-based, and long-term care; reproductive care; all safe and comprehensive cancer treatments; and prescription drugs.*""

We don't need to nationalize health insurance. We need to nationalize the entire healthcare industry. Also, she forgot to say that she wants to cover *all* prescription drugs.

""*Support Teachers. It is impossible to create a positive learning environment for students when our teachers are not paid a living wage. Alexandra will fight to raise the minimum teacher wage to at least $60,000 and support the rights of our educators to unionize.*""

$60k??? The average pay in Hunt's district is already $60k...

""*Demilitarize the Police. Alexandra understands that gun safety policy and police reform go hand-in-hand.  In Congress, Alexandra will fight to demilitarize all law enforcement, including police officers and security guards, starting immediately with all military-grade weaponry and equipment. She will advocate for the Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act and ending the federal 1033 Program that provides military weaponry to local police departments.*""

ABOLISH\* the police.

""*Housing for All. Alexandra believes that housing is a human right and that stable housing is essential to community prosperity, which is why she supports the Green New Deal for Public Housing Act. The Green New Deal for Public Housing invests in the construction of sustainable public housing options priced at affordable real cost or income-based rates. She advocates for inclusive social housing as an equitable public solution for people of every race, income level, and documentation status. In Philly, this policy would focus on revitalizing old and abandoned housing, retrofitting them with high-efficiency energy systems and appliances. Currently, Black single mothers are most at risk for facing eviction or housing insecurity, making this group a top priority in the demand for housing.* ""

There are 17 million empty houses in the US, and only 500 thousand homeless people. You give housing for all by guaranteeing a house FOR ALL. We can do that right now, and there'd still be 16.5 million empty houses in the US. The problem doesn't need another 10 years to solve. Also, are you funding private energy companies to pay for these energy systems/appliances? Nice way to support funneling more money to the top.

""*Tenants‚Äô Rights. Alexandra will protect tenants by implementing a national rent control standard and a ‚Äújust cause‚Äù requirement for evictions. She will fight to end housing discrimination and ensure housing standards for renters. Alexandra will support the rights of tenants to form tenant unions without retaliation from landlords and will protect survivors of domestic violence from eviction on the basis of their assault. She will support efforts to fully fund the Section 8 rental assistance program and will implement a Section 8 non-discrimination law so landlords cannot discriminate against low-income families or persons.* ""

NO EVICTIONS. PERIOD.

""*Reproductive Rights. Alexandra supports every person‚Äôs religious freedom and right to choose, which is why she is a proponent of reproductive justice and advocates for inclusive reproductive legislation. Alexandra will fight to repeal the Hyde Amendment, oppose efforts to overturn Roe v. Wade, and advocate to expand the WIC program to make reproductive health services affordable and available before, during, and after pregnancy. She will fight to fully fund Planned Parenthood, Title X, and other reproductive justice initiatives that protect and increase the availability of safe and legal abortion and access to contraception. Alexandra understands that equitable reproductive justice supports maternal health and childcare as much as legal and safe abortion and contraception.*""

What about codifying Roe v Wade? What about making reproductive health services FREE (not just affordable)? Why not also include FREE menstrual products??? Women shouldn't have to choose between food on the table and their tampons.

""*The Right to a Dignified Living. Alexandra will support increasing the amount of federal funding for tribal nations with significant investments into communities that lack healthcare, employment opportunities, housing, and quality schools. Enacting the Green New Deal will include the federal jobs guarantee, which will help provide jobs and rebuild the economies of Native communities.*""

Your olive branch to Natives is the Green New Deal? Your solution to the US taking and destroying Native land is to *let* Natives work towards fixing the problems that we caused? Tbh, this is pretty fucked up.

""*Diplomacy. In order to see such a shift in the United States‚Äô foreign policy, adequate resources for strategies of diplomacy, humanitarian aid, development, and healing from war need to be reallocated. Alexandra believes the threats our nation faces can be addressed more effectively with principled diplomacy rather than with bombs, aggressive posturing, or war. Alexandra will support increased funding for the State Department, humanitarian aid, and community-led international development programs. She will advocate for the application of good-faith diplomacy and the increase in the number of refugees welcomed into the U.S.* ""

""INCREASED FUNDING FOR THE STATE DEPARTMENT""?!?!?! WHAT ABOUT THE WHOLE ""Alexandra stands in opposition to colonialism, imperialism, and all other violations to the right to self-determination in governance""???

""*Environmental Justice for Philly and Ending Food Insecurity. Alexandra will bring the fight against climate change to Philly by supporting green public housing projects, increasing access to healthy and sustainable food, and supporting grassroots activist efforts to end the environmental racism that puts Philly‚Äôs Black and low-income residents at a high risk of exposure to polluted air and water.*""

Shit, I‚Äôm from Hawaii and we had ‚Äúkill haole‚Äù day at school. It‚Äôs pretty tame these days but it used to be down right brutal and some thought they were justified for one reason or another because whites as a race ‚Äúdeserved it‚Äù. 

One must also remember when your average white guy from a working/middle class background grows up, does what he‚Äôs supposed to, works hard and ends up fairly successful, he doesn‚Äôt think to himself ‚Äúman it‚Äôs good to be white!‚Äù. For him it just affirms his belief that doing the right thing pays off. So if he‚Äôs constantly bombarded about ‚Äúwhiteness‚Äù and ‚Äúwhite privilege‚Äù it‚Äôs an abstract and often insulting concept to him. What was he supposed to do? He was born white, and did what he was told and it worked out for him.

> Former Nazi official Albert Krebs described the scene in his memoirs: ‚ÄúNot all capitalists were particularly enthusiastic about the Nazis, but their skepticism was relative and ended as soon as it became clear that Hitler was the only person capable of destroying the labor movement.‚Äù Terrified by the prospect of further gains for the labor movement, capital‚Äôs support for Hitler grew rapidly.

> Trotsky illustrated the dynamic colorfully: ‚ÄúThe big bourgeoisie likes fascism as little as a man with aching molars likes to have his teeth pulled‚Äù ‚Äî that is to say, it was ugly, but it was necessary. Hitler kept his promise to capital. After being declared Chancellor in January 1933 he outlawed both workers‚Äô parties and the trade unions within a few months. Thousands of Social Democrats, Communists and trade unionists were arrested and murdered.

Two points:

1. Unlike 1930s Germany, the other major group is clearly pro-capitalist, so these American capitalists shouldnt feel a need to turn to Nazis, and
2. Hitler and the Nazis ultimately were not good for the capitalists as they were dragged into a destructive war that ended with Germany in ruins, and with IG Farben wound up"

How we got into this mess:

* Federal government says ""More education is good - a college degree always pays off in the long run, so we will loan students as much as is needed.  Or we will guarantee private lenders, which is sort of the same thing.""
* Universities say ""Students can get loans - they can afford more tuition, and we need to expand faculty/staff/facilities, so we're raising tuition.""
* State governments say ""Students can get loans, so we can stop subsidizing state school tuition with state taxes - they can raise tuition.""
* People who sell stuff to students (housing, restaurants, etc...) say ""Students have loans - they can afford nicer stuff, so we can raise prices, build more expensive housing and restaurants, etc...""

Cancel student debt, but make sure we don't continue to enable the mess above:

* Federal government is on the hook for most of the $$, but has to stop loaning $$ to people who can't possibly repay it.  Give grants to low-income people who actually need it, but no more money fountain.
* Universities need to unwind tuition increases - they'll have to if there is no more student loan money fountain.
* State governments need to support state schools again - same reason.
* Universities with massive endowments should be forced to pay the federal government.

"36691",9119,"hy3tcz8",1,0,"/r/politics","Global oil economics are horrifically complex.  Anyone who simply points to something like ""We used to export more than we imported, so we were energy independent"" doesn't have the first clue what they are talking about.  The notion that being a net exporter makes you ""energy independent"" belies just how little one understands the global oil market.

First, not all oil is the same. There are four different types of crude (actually about 160 when you get into sub-groups), and those types are used to make different types and qualities of distillates.  For example, light oil can be used for transportation fuels (e.g. petrol) but not much else; heavy crude can be used for many transportation fuels, but also plastics and composites.  

Second, not only do these fuels have different uses, but also they have different prices.  So if you reroute one type of oil for a different type of production, that can have tremendous spillover effects for consumers.  Hard to be ""energy independent"" if, for example, it means the cost of gasoline goes to $6/gallon or you can't pave streets because asphalt isn't available.

Third, there are different types of refineries with different processes to conform to the market needs and regulations of the target market.  They also have to be configured in such a way as to process the type of crude they are receiving. Refineries aren't a simple plug-and-play for different types of oil and different markets.  

Fourth, transportation and logistics is tremendously complicated. We export oil from specific sites to specific destinations because of the cost of transport. This was the entire purpose of the Keystone Pipeline -- it was designed to move crude from Canada down to the Gulf Coast refineries (with some stops along the way) -- but those refineries were then going to export the products to Europe and Latin America.  

The reality is that oil markets are far more complicated than just asking if X - I > 0.  Just because you are a net exporter doesn't mean that you have achieved energy independence."

Why people find this so hard to do is because by default when we hate someone or something, we hate anything they do or stand for. The problem with this is that it narrows your world view quite a bit, and you miss out on things that could very much be a learning experience or to find something you like. Examples, Hitler took a country that was on the brink of utter collapse, and completely turned it around into a super power. Putin currently has the whole world eating out of his hand waiting on his next moves, and cannot directly do anything with his current moves. These are objectively bad people that have done some pretty impressive things. Others would be like the 1-2 songs Justin Beiber has that are actually pretty good.

Now, in the case of Trump, the dude is not an idiot. He is a raging narcissist and a complete garbage human, but not an idiot, and he can tell Putin is doing something QUITE clever. Usually a person would keep the fuck quiet on something like this, or talk to close friends..... but yeah, just because you dislike Putin/Trump and are unwilling to objectively look at the situation and admit dude is making some smart moves and the world is on egg shells, will lead us to WW3 for sure!!!!

The world and it's politics and ideologies are a pendulum, the further you swing that damn axe, the sooner it will eventually swing back the other way, and the further you push it one way the further it will push back the other way when it does.

Trump incited the riot on live TV and so far, not only has he not been arrested but there is no real sign of any Justice Department-led investigation that would lead to such an arrest.

With all due respect to the writer (her book title alone deserves it) and her desire for action and headlines it could be that Garland's DOJ just doesn't leak like Barr's.

"41501",9600,"hy3stth",1,0,"/r/politics","I‚Äôd like to offer some ‚Äògood case scenario‚Äô analysis, centering around the motives of the players.

So first of all, a large scale invasion won‚Äôt happen. If it does, the sanctions on Russia will be crippling. The trade with Europe will be affected and many American companies have vital interest in them and in the broad European economy. I doubt if anyone wants that to happen at all.

Second of all, let‚Äôs examine the motive of Putin. What does he want? He knows Ukraine is drifting away and at this point it‚Äôs pretty much irreversible. But to safeguard the border, he would have to have some ‚Äòbuffer zone‚Äô. Therefore he orchestrated the ‚Äòindependence‚Äô of these two regions, placing the military around Ukraine as a threat to make sure Ukraine does not respond fiercely. Now that he got the buffer zone he wanted, it‚Äôs doubtful that he is willing to escalate this. Since Ukraine is not In NATO, the NATO will basically just be training and supplying some weapons. It‚Äôs very unlikely that they will venture an incursion into the Donbas region.

Now finally, what does the US want? Why the US is acting like a maniac, almost unilaterally declaring that Russia is going to invade Ukraine like ghengis khan leading his steeds and cover the country with blood? Why it‚Äôs denying any possibility of accepting some of Putin‚Äôs demands as if wanting there to be major conflict? First of all, US wants an unstable and weak Russia. Making the situation bigger will allow the US to come up with more severe sanctions. It can also shake up the ties between European countries and Russia, ensuring that the US‚Äôs dominance will persist (if we ignore China for a second). There is absolutely no way that the US is going to put boots on the ground. But the weapon companies are very happy to sell more weapons, either to the pentagon to donate them or to Eastern European countries who feel threatened by the move. So weaker opponent and profit on the fears, why not?

My guess is that this is Putin‚Äôs multi-year (or even decade) plan to encroach the eastern Ukraine, possibly up to Kyiv. This step will be just like the 2014 Crimea crisis, put a little dent in the market and then it‚Äôs effects will fizzle out."

At this point, the racial breakdown of your cast and characters is always under political analysis.

In this case, the decision to prosecute or not prosecute are both political, just on opposite sides.  The decision to follow the law is a political stance.  It's one *you assume everyone should agree on* but it's still a political stance.

To expand further, I'm not interested in applying the law equally.  I think poor people should be allowed to steal food, but the rich should not.  I think that our drug law are also immoral.

2) I think it's missing the bigger picture in favor of a couple of true-ish details. 


>The nuclear family concept is an artificial construct designed by an outdated system of puritanical morals.

What is an artificial construct? Picking a berry from a bush to eat may be as conceivably ""natural"" an act as one could imagine a human doing, but how about spearing a wild boar? We have the digestive system and dental structure to suggest and omnivorous diet, we have opposable thumbs and the dexterity to suggest we are natural tool-makers, is the spear an artificial construct?

Everything humans create, and all of the behaviors humans exhibit are products of our evolutionary programming. Some instinctual,  some learned post-birth, our vocal cords are the evolutionary result of the advantage being able to transfer this learned knowledge was.

The ""puritanical morals"" stem from our evolutionary roots as well. Humans didn't just randomly decide ""women should be virgins"", but it was a policy derived from men's aversion to investing resources in a mate that may not be bearing his child. It's not common throughout history that women specifically seek out virgin men, because they simply cannot physically bear another women's child. What is common is that men in positions of power attract the attention of women, because of the implication of safety and resources during a vulnerable pregnancy. Men that ""did not care"" about a woman's promiscuity were more likely to end up raising the offspring of another man and not passing on *his* genes, so you end up with a male population that tend to be sexually possessive and exhibit behaviors like mate guarding. 

>Going back before modern religion, we see tribes that lived as a communal entity to care for children, the old, and the infirm.

This is true! But nomadic tribes function differently than more modern societies. Our ""natural"" sexual tendencies can be inferred by our genitalia and level sexual dimorphism between sexes. When both sexes look roughly the same, that's an indicator that there isn't much competition and offspring are either raised as a community or left to fend for themselves. When there is a larger physical difference between males and females, that indicates males have to ""compete"" for females and tend to grow larger, stronger, develop large horns or impressive colorful feathers. Testical volume also determines the level of competition, and is indicative of a more ""poly"" society. Humans are ""naturally"" somewhere in the middle. We tend to gravitate towards short term monogamy with some extra partners when a good opportunity presents itself. This makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint, but I'm going to cut it here before I drone on too long.

>Polyandrous and polygynous societies were not uncommon, and there is some anthropological evidence that they were as strong as if not more so than the modern christian version of society.

As with everything when it comes to evolution, the most successful strategy dominates. Poly societies are not the dominate force today because they are not conducive to the continuation of large societies. There is nothing ""wrong"" with poly, they are just simply unsustainable. In monogamous societies, men have the motivation of a woman of their own and a family to provide for to drive productivity. In large scale poly societies, there are incredibly large numbers of men that do not get a partner and this becomes self destructive."

"44891",9939,"hy42rqs",3,0,"/r/politics","I mean it's anecdotal but personally I've had friends that I went to school with as a kid just do a complete 180 on me as adults when we caught up. I grew up in a really diverse part of CA as a kid, I never really saw any kind of racism or racial tension in my day to day life or at school as a kid. I only really started to experience it when I was older and moved around to other states after college. 

I had a girl who I was close friends with in high school blow up on me when we caught up many years later because I mentioned I had bought a house. She started talking about how the only reason I could do that in my 30s was because of my privilege. I thought it was because I worked really hard and saved money for almost 15 years and maintained good credit. She told me I was part of what was wrong with the world and I never heard from her again. I'm not rich, I'm not poor, I have a bit of savings and I can cover my cost of living + mortgage. So I really don't know why I am a bad guy for that.

I've had a few other similar experiences (even from white friends surprisingly) where talking about any success or positivity in my life elicits a very negative racially charged response. It even happened with my ex-wife when she told me about a skinhead that worked at a grocery store she went to. She got mad at me for not being mad enough about it. I basically told her I just wouldn't go to that store anymore, she thought she needed to call the store management and the police and get him arrested or something (dude literally could have just been bald, idk I wasn't there). She called me a little white pussy when I said I'd probably leave the town I was living if it got an influx of neo-nazi residents on the streets.   

For context, I guess I'm considered white, but I'm Jewish and what was left of my family after the holocaust came here after WW2 to escape persecution. My grandfather pumped gas and lived in a black neighborhood in Detroit. My father grew up going to mostly black schools and he never had issues with his peers or neighbors growing up. I never had negative racial experiences growing up either going to a very diverse school. Maybe it was just some fortunate combination of time and place that led to that, but growing up I genuinely believed the whole ""America is a melting pot and everyone is equal"" mentality, so did my peers (at least at the time).

To people who maybe had similar situations to me it definitely feels like there is a difference in attitude. Now, even reading comments on this thread, or looking at social media, it feels like people think my entire family tree was full of slave owners and nazis (the people who literally wiped out whole branches of my family tree) just because I have pale skin. It feels like everyone in general is regressing when it comes to race.

But top comment is right, it hasn't had any major economic effect on me. I've lost a bunch of friends who just seem to want to see me for my skin color and what I own, vs. who I am as a person and that sucks, but it could definitely be worse. Obviously the OP article isn't about people like me, but the problem is that I get lumped into the same category as those people. I guess some people would think maybe I deserve that somehow, but to me that comes off pretty racist."

He talked about structural economic issues in addition to just front line stuff like raising the minimum wage eg infrastructure, jobs, Which are also not necessarily in progressives‚Äô wheelhouse.

Like, if we game this out for a sec, and Trump keeps praising Russia, can the GOP go all the way to siding with Russia?  What does that look like if we're sending troops? Goodness gracious, my brain just jumped to some military coup possibilities I'm just gonna keep to myself.

There's this seemingly unkillable shibboleth of an idea on the left, that the way to make the Democrats shift left is to ""punish them"" by letting Republicans win, despite being completely ass-backwards. Letting the Republicans win has only served to keep pushing the Democrats **to the right.** 

If people want to push the Democrats to the left, these things need to happen:

1) Democratic politicians need to feel secure that passing laws for left-leaning priorities will get them reelected, not voted out.

2) They need to feel like running left will not cost them in a general election.

3) They need to feel that the real threat to staying in office is that they will lose a primary challenge from the left.

This is exactly the mechanism by which the Republican party moved to the right, because Republicans in congress aren't afraid of general elections, they're afraid of a primary challenge from the right.

tl;dr - You want to move the Dems to the left, vote blue no matter what in the general election, and vote for the most left-leaning viable candidate in the primary, every time."

You know who fought against it the whole time but then claimed credit for legalizing? The fucking Republicans. Ask people, and they'll say it was the fucking Republicans who did the work to make it happen - because even though the Republicans fought against it, they did it on the sly, and the publicly sided with it once public opinion became clear to any part of their base that supports it, while the Democrats are still openly and loudly fighting against something the vast majority of the state and their constituents support, actively undermining it for as long as possible both in the legislature and the media.

>An additional 58 to 72 homicides were reported each month, totaling to more than 700 each year.  
             
>However, the study showed no evidence of a decrease in homicides in any states after implementing the laws, while the nation overall reported an ""abrupt and sustained"" increase in monthly homicides and firearm homicides.""  
               
>Increases in homicides were greater in southern states such as Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Louisiana, with spikes of as much as 35%.

1. The Italians were already working on improving their trains when Mussolini popped up, and 
2. The only trains running well were a few used by tourists and Italian elites

> ‚ÄúThe story that Mussolini made the trains run on time arose in the late ‚Äò20s and gained credence abroad mainly because of well-heeled British tourists who considered the hopelessly refractory Italians governable only by dictatorial means,‚Äù wrote Victoria de Grazia, a Columbia history professor, in The New York Times back in 1994. ‚ÄúHis regime built magnificent central stations and upgraded the main lines on which businessmen, politicians and comfort-minded tourists sped between Milan and Rome.‚Äù

However

> These direttissima (‚Äúmost direct‚Äù) lines, construction of which began before World War I, were engineering marvels; when it opened in 1934, the 11.5-mile double-tracked tunnel through the Apennines between Bologna and Florence was the second-longest in the world. (Nearly 100 workers were killed during its construction.) But Il Duce‚Äôs state-run railroads remained a mixed bag for most working men and women. ‚ÄúThe railroad workers' union was dissolved and nearly 50,000 employees were fired on political grounds,‚Äù de Grazia wrote. ‚ÄúThe toll for work accidents on heroic projects soared. As the direttissimi whizzed by on schedule, aged commuter locals filled with workers were shunted onto sidings.‚Äù"

If you‚Äôre discussing the *circumstances* surrounding when a person is allowed to use deadly force to protect herself, the only thing which really changes is the most trivial.  In practice, the line between ‚ÄúI was in fear for my life‚Äù and ‚ÄúI was in fear for my life and did not think I could get away‚Äù is very, *very* thin in a courtroom.

Don‚Äôt believe me?  Look at the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse: the judge ruled that none of the ~~crimes Rittenhouse committed~~ ‚Äúcircumstances‚Äù leading up to the shootings mattered, only whether Rittenhouse was reasonably in fear of his life at the moment he pulled the trigger.  Wisconsin does not have SYG.  Wisconsin‚Äôs deadly force law includes the threat of grievous bodily harm (meaning his brandishing a rifle could be considered deadly force in and of itself).  Wisconsin‚Äôs deadly force laws specifically prohibit the use of deadly force to defend property which does not belong to to the defender.  Wisconsin‚Äôs deadly force law specifically invalidates the use of deadly force if the need for it is prompted by the commission of a crime.  *None of that mattered*.

Side note: if it seems like the judge simply disregarded the laws of his own state to stack the deck in favor of the defendant, I wholeheartedly agree with you.  I‚Äôm still salty over that case‚Äîbut‚Ä¶point remains.

You came in and said ""Obviously it's not hardcore porn but I don't see how it's not a form of porn.""

And that is where I chimed in with ""There's a difference between doing some modeling porn and ""porno"" imo,"" and subsequently bring up the film related connotation of adding the 'o' at the end. 

The two are *not* used interchangeably in common usage, and the original response (""are we really calling it a porno"") is evidence of that. Another user thought that porno has a more specific, hardcore inflection behind it. This whole thing *literally* started because the original responder got the wrong idea when the original commenter used a word with a connotation they did not realize it had.

You're not *wrong* to call a magazine a porno, you should just understand that when you do so, a lot of people will get the wrong idea. When you say ""a porno of the first lady,"" that specifically implies a (probably penetrative) video to a large chunk of the population."

"53281",10778,"hy0bvbj",5,0,"/r/politics","There are several problems with a simple statement like ""forgive all the debt"".  As well as good examples of possible solutions for long term fixes going forward.

Here's a couple problems:

1.  Like it or not, people (adults) took on these loans.  It is ultimately the individual's responsibility to weigh all the possible repercussions of taking on such loans and their likelihood to be able to repay the loans.  Now there's a ton of factors there.  Like being ""oversold"" on the idea of the loans to begin with, being convinced to take the loans under pressure, cant get a job afterwards that pays enough, etc.  Lots of stuff that can be mitigating factors for the loan holders that work in their favor.  But even so they knowingly took on the loans.  I don't think complete loan forgiveness for everyone across the board is a good idea.  That is a serious moral hazard.  This is like the banks before 2008 taking the profits and making all the risks public.  It is by no means the same morally of course because college students don't generally take the loans assuming they will get bailed out.  But completely forgiveness is this type of hazard.  So the question is what level of responsibility does the loan holder have for taking the loan in the first place?  None?  Some?  All?

2. Less than half of Americans get college degrees.  Should the half that do not have college degrees foot the bill for those that do?  How about all the folks to went to trade schools and carry a debt?  How about folks who took any special training and had to pay out of their own pocket? Seems like they should get a break as well. Yes?  If not, why should their tax money go only to those who wanted to pay for college?

3. What responsibility do colleges/universities have?  Especially given they have jacked prices well beyond inflation over the last few decades.  Also, if the loans just get wiped out, it wont be the colleges that foot the bill.  It will be the government and therefore the tax payers.  Does this not incentive college to keep jacking prices to crazy levels knowing the gov will foot the bill?  Seem like that is a bad incentive structure.


Australia offers a possible solution:

* Loans are through the government.
* College pricing is limited to prevent issue #3 above.
* You only start paying back when you hit a certain income.
* If you never hit that income you never pay it back.
* Regardless, after a certain period of paying back, even if you have not paid it all back, the remainder is forgiven.

There are probably other solutions.  Certainly as many have said a good start is to just set interest to 0%.  But we need a system wide ""permanent"" fix.  And all these articles dont do a lot of problem solving.  They mostly just quote a bunch of folks saying all loans should be forgiven.  It's just low quality journalism in many cases."

Trump tapped into anger and resentment in 2016, and it turns out with Fox News and conservative media demonizing Joe Biden as a radical leftist, that's all you need to do to have a competitive party in this country.

I think we all ( or at least I did ) assumed voices like Romney, Collins, Murkowski would find this too abhorrent and potentially start a third party ( that's what has happened historically when the difference intra-party are too strong ) but modern politics prohibits that with both major parties entrenching themselves so much that a third party with a meaningful agenga is fruitless."

A 50-50 senate with Joe Manchin as the 50th vote means that we can only be as progressive as Joe Manchin wants us to be. 

If democrats had gotten more votes, had gotten just a few more senate seats, then you would see real talk about filibuster reform and then you could see big pieces of legislation moving to the presidents desk. Even in a 50-50 senate, they pushed for it hard. Tried to get Manchin there, and they are still pushing, but Biden isn‚Äôt a dictator and Senators get yo vote how they want, even if they caucus as a democrat.
