4,"hy20nzb",3,1,"/r/Conservative","Had Hilary won the election this would be the here and now. Trump was so hated by the elite establishment that the significant participants of said establishment stopped blending in to openly attack him. Without Trump we wouldn't have known how shady tech companies were, whether it's PayPal, social media's, Google, gofundme. We wouldn't have payed as much attention to media bias or intentional disinformation in articles only to be edited after the damage was done. If Hillary won the election the courts would be stacked blue, the media would have carried her through 2 terms and the democrat's destruction would have been a much slower process allowing them to squeeze by bad policy after bad policy and still keep a majority of americans voting for them because they are constantly assured the dems have ""good intentions"". It would have been the end of the Republican party and the beginning of totalitarian government radicalizing children in schools and no one would have known. Covid would have come and gone and the deaths would be reported as ""unavoidable"" and ""Hillary did the best she could"". They would have a lot of uninformed voters blindly doing what they're told and because they hated Trump so much they put too much spotlight on him people like me and millions of others became interested in politics and started questioning things. Regardless of policy or personal opinions of the guy, he inadvertently did more for the future of the country than any other Republican president IMO by simply letting these power-hungry elites roar their ugly heads.

10,"hy3gow6",3,1,"/r/Conservative","The whole point of NATO expansion is extending the US defense commitment and nuclear umbrella to foreign nations.

After the fall of the Berlin Wall, NATO expanded eastward, incorporating Poland and the Baltic States which were huge wins for the US and Western European powers, especially Germany, because the zone of conflict moved out of their territory.

It's naive to think further expansion of NATO into Ukraine would enhance security for the US or Europe.

Biden should negotiate with the Russians, which was the point of that Minsk accords which the US never took seriously.  The old deal proposed by Russia was to provide some level of autonomy to the Donbass regions while keeping Ukraine free of foreign troops.

The US never engaged in that bargaining because the deep state types thought they could make Ukraine NATO membership a done deal by increments.

Now, Putin has taken that off the table.  Ukraine is now a state with active military dispute inside its official borders.  They *can't* get into NATO now because that would automatically trigger Article 5 of collective defense.

But the Biden administration will not engage in this realpolitik approach.  They will bluster about and issue sanctions etc.  But it's all just noise, while the Russians will get what they were after which is preventing Ukraine from joining NATO.

In terms of OP question, it's laughable to think any American president can make an argument for military intervention with Congress or the American public to protect Ukraine's territorial integrity."

1) Twitter and reddit are not generally where you find logical people. Not all, but most people on the platforms are complete morons. Many of my fellow countrymen and woman included. 

2) I agree that action has to be met with action. Conservative weakness in the country is selling out freedom to a loud minority of crazy people. We really should do more to keep the country we love but we are labeled terrorist, our info is controlled by left winged powerhouses, we are censored and shamed, and people are afraid of losing their jobs and livelihoods (look at Canada).  

3) This is purely my opinion, but I think that if the US is going to claim alliance with another country, then we should defend them militarily, if needed. All that stated, the left has destroyed our unity and without that, America truly isn't that powerful right now. I think it's fair that we need to get our own shit in order before we can go and help anyone else. The left have put us in this position and most Republicans I know are in favor of protecting our allies. It's become very complicated."

> Oil production has very little to do with the president. 

This is false.  In 'tha biz'.  While I'm no 'expert', I'll give you some insight...

While it's true that Biden doesn't directly 'control' prices, the effect that his (& largely Democrat, et al) political policies, ideologies, and words definitely can't be understated. It VERY much drives sentiment and investment. The pricing slump of '20 was absolutely devastating to production / tool / associated companies. Not just due to lack of demand, but a supply glut previously unparalleled, largely thanks to a Russia / Saud & UAE pricing war. Not just resulting in a massive production cut, but I've seen numbers in the 270's estimating bankruptcies in the sector during '20/'21. When you have a president that ran on political policies pushing for 'green' this & that, dumping executive orders to that effect left & right, being basically a rubber stamp for anything 'green' that congress squeaks by, ICE cars announced to cease production (thanks to government penalties) across multiple major auto manufacturers, record investments into EV auto's, the investment money and willingness to re-enter that market dry up pretty quick from all but the most die hard or brave. You've also got to remember, a LOT of those investors are actual boomers, probably past retirement age at this point, or at least looking for that final exit.  Good luck getting any younger investors.  Hell, even I'm reluctant (middle aged) to put much of my portfolio in any related companies. A lot of this is anecdotal from first hand experience, but while there is a slow rise in activity, the 'rubber banding' in production that generally coincides with decreasing supply & rising prices seems much slower and way more muted than previous 'comeback's'. Tag on ~15% inflation, slowly increasing demand, an international incident... and it doesn't take a genius.

I mean, ""yay team green!"" & whatever... but it's gonna hurt for a while if you're still pumping gas. It's gonna hurt bad, and Biden seems to be fresh out of Novocaine.

However, the reality is that if you look at non-2020 numbers, 2021 was a return to normal. To state ""Oil imports have increased 600%"" means nothing when comparing to 2020 when frankly global demand had cratered.  

As I said, it would be like crediting Biden for the fact domestic oil production has climbed since Trump left office, which you would not be willing to do. Nor would I, as in both situations, it's the free market at work.    For the increase of oil imports to be a bad thing, you'd have to be able to point to a drop in domestic oil production which we are unable to do.

3. When you go out in public, you accept the risks that come with it. If you are afraid of getting infected when going outside, why should I have to get a vaccination that **wouldn't prevent you from getting the virus from me to begin with**?

Seriously, I don't get the logic here. I can infect you either way, regardless of how vaccinated I am.

Couldn't even bother to show the performance and the family at the same time, which would really have brought some heart to the programming that times like these *especially* call for when you have no real crowd to speak of.

We vote for MP's to represent us, every single MP sitting in Parliament right now got more votes than their rival.  The reason why Conservatives have more votes overall is their stronghold ridings vote more heavily in favour of them so they win by a larger margin.  Keep in mind we have 2 major left parties, the Liberal and NDP so the left vote is often split between them reducing their margin of victory across the country.


So as a simple example.  Say we have 3 ridings with 1000 voters in each.  In riding A the Conservative candidate wins  with 700 votes and the Liberal candidate only got 50.  In riding B The Liberal candidate wins with 550 votes and the Conservative got 400.  In riding C the Liberal wins again with 600 and the Conservative gets 350.

So we have 2 Liberal seats won and 1 Conservative but the Conservatives in total got 1450 votes and the Liberals only got 1200.  But everyone won the popular vote, and everyone's vote counted the same.  It's not a perfect system by any means, but how else do you do it?

2376,"hxv6quk",3,1,"/r/Conservative","Two weeks ago I went to my first appointment with my new endocrinologist. She was the first doctor to say something that made me feel not crazy.

I got vaccinated back in April of last year with my second shot in May. Pretty normal stuff. A few days later when I was out on a ride on my bike I noticed that my heart rate was higher than normal on that hill. I persevered and made it to the top. Over the next six months that happened with increasing frequency. In November I was on a very easy ride, maybe 100W if you're into numbers, and my heart rate was going crazy. On my way back home, skipping any hills, my heart rate topped out over 200 BPM.

This was concerning.

I started putting off calling a doctor like so many guys. My wife convinced me to go, thankfully.

The first doctor when told that ""I think it might be due to the vaccine?"", well he just responded somewhat reflexively that ""the vaccine is safe and effective; now go see a cardiologist.""

The second doctor, the cardiologist, did a bunch of tests. It turns out I was in atrial fibrillation maybe 1% of the time. He put me on calcium channel blockers. When asked about potential vaccine connections he was a bit more circumspect: ""there are so many things that can cause this, it may be, it may not be, but the vaccines are a good thing.""

The results of the blood tests from the first doc finally came in: hyperthyroidism. A bunch of annoyance later I finally got an appointment.

She asked when I started getting these symptoms. ""Doctor, please don't hate me for this, and I'm not an anti-vaxxer and I got my first dose immediately after being eligible, but I started getting this right after my second vaccination."" I was already setting this up to fail. ""Oh, I've seen a bit uptick in thyroid issues along with a bunch of autoimmune diseases. It can cause thyroiditis, Grave's Disease, Hashimoto's Disease. Whenever someone comes in with something I start having to ask around to see if anyone else has seen that.""

I swear I was being gaslighted for the past couple of months and I was going crazy.

It doesn't solve anything just by that, but it at least makes me feel better.

So yes when you have regional areas voting for different parties it’s going to end up being called quickly when the elections are run as smoothly as they are in Canada.   

I’ve worked Canadian elections before and what will happen is each riding will have dozens and dozens of polling stations.   For example in the city I grew up in of 100k people was considered it’s own riding.    In my neighbourhood there was two polling locations (two elementary schools) and there were locations in each neighbourhood.   Inside each location is multiple polling stations,  on you’re voter registration card (which gets mailed to every person who files a tax return)  it will tell you which polling station you vote at.  It’s done by hand with paper ballots.  You get your ballot, mark it, place it in a box.   When the polls close those boxes are moved to the returning office where the two people who ran that polling station will then count the votes (some times there will be an additional person who helps them).  The times I did this I think we counted between 1500-2000 votes and then the results are given to the returning officers who run the returns office.   It took a couple hours to count, and recount to make sure.   After that the results get reported.

No, you don't. You're paying for your healthcare via your higher taxes.

I previously had a government job here in the U.S. where I had what was effectively ""free/subsidized"" through my employer dental (it was basically, on very small scale, what government provided dental would look like) as one of the benefits and it was an absolutely fucking nightmare to use. I would call the number they provided, it would take about 10 times calling over the course of several days (during normal business hours, mind you) to finally get someone to pick up who would direct me to another number that actually had to call to set up an appointment. When I finally could get a hold of someone after several days of phone tag, I'd have to commit to one of the only two available time slots at odd times about 4 months into the future. I fucking hated.

I now got to a typical, small town, private practice clinic (with private dental insurance that's about $15-20 per month). The difference is night and day. I call, someone immediately picks up, they're very friendly, and there's a lot of times for me the choose from that I don't have to rearrange my schedule for. And it the past, when I have had my appointment at the last minute, they can reschedule for something else within the next few weeks. 

Well worth it. And if I didn't have private insurance, I would simply pay out of pocket about $100-120 twice per year for cleanings so it's not much of difference either. I'd much rather pay for good service than get something for ""free"" from our government. Our federal government is run by stupid, worthless bureaucrats who do nothing but fuck up our country and waste everyone's money. They ruin everything they touch. Maybe they're better and more competent in your country."

You got the time zone shift so you can find out the results before it even airs on TV.

You got YouTube and online media now, easier to just watch highlights of your favorite sport rather than trying to figure out the exact time your sport airs on TV.

Then the games themselves weren’t all that good. There wasn’t really have a breakout star this Olympics—no big “Michael Phelps” characters this year. NHL players didn’t participate, Shawn White didn’t medal, men’s Curling didn’t medal, most of big American athletes underperformed. Granted there was a few Americans who performed well, but most of the big “household names” (other than maybe Chloe Kim?) either have already retired or underperformed.

And then you got all of the obnoxious stuff. The IOC let someone who failed a drug test (from a country that was suspended due to doping) compete anyway. And then you have all of the geopolitical nonsense surrounding China, Ukraine, etc. going on.

COVID was a really scary time, people dying all around you, including the occasional coworker, with a skewed sense of mortality wondering if you'll be next. Seeing all of the mistakes taking place, wondering that if you servive if will you be sued? Will you even want to live if you survive? There just wasn't enough time or supplies to do everything that you needed to do to save people. That leads to moral injury and PTSD.

There is just no way to spin that as being anything but authoritarian when the vaccine is freely available for anyone to take if they want to and each variant has been milder than the last.  It's really hard to argue public health when all the unvaxxed people I know who have had omicron have said it wasn't any worse than a common cold.

Because at the moment when the modern Romanian state was created by the unification between the Wallachia and Moldavia (1859), the present territory of the Republic of Moldova (the eastern part of Moldavia) had been already taken by Russia (1812). Unlike other territories under Russian rule, namely Poland or Finland, this was not really an entire country and was not treated as such, but underwent a process of colonization and Russification.

4876,"hy3v4b8",3,1,"/r/Conservative","The problem is that politicians politicized the vaccines, overpromised on the effectiveness of the vaccines, and conditioned the removal of mandates on the effectiveness of vaccines.

The vaccines have been effective, but not in the way that they were advertised by politicians.  Politicians lied to everyone when they claimed vaccination prevented transmission.  They don't.  Vaccines never have.  Sterilizing immunity is a myth, but politicians used the popular belief in that myth to trick people.  The hypothesis that vaccinated people would be less likely to transmit the virus, on account of a theoretical reduced viral load, was absurd, because attenuated symptoms increase the likelihood that a person continues to expose other people.  IOW, with attenuated symptoms, a person is more likely to become a Typhoid Mary.

The vaccines have been effective in reducing the likelihood of hospitalization and death.  The degree to which they've been effective depends on the strain.  They were more effective against the original strain.  The fact that vaccinated people have died is not proof that the vaccines don't work.  The fact that vaccinated people represent a majority of hospitalizations is also not proof the vaccines don't work (this is a function of the vaccination rate in the general population, not the effectiveness of the vaccines).  Some proportion of people are always going to die from this virus, because it has the ability to infect the lungs, and there are always going to be people who are on death's doorstep.  

Honestly, the best course of action would have been to let low-risk people continue with their daily lives, and advise high-risk people to isolate.  The population of low-risk people would have quickly developed strong natural immunity, possibly herd immunity, and then when vaccines became available, high-risk people could get a leg up on the virus and lower their risk of hospitalization or death."

There are 338 constituencies/seats (called ""ridings"" in Canada), and the party that wins the most seats is given the first opportunity to form government.

The Liberals (Trudeau's party) currently have 159 seats, which is less than half of the total seats up for grabs, meaning they need the support of another party (typically the NDP -- the socialist party) to pass any bills. I would say maybe 90-95% of the time the NDP supports the Liberals, under their currently leader they're seen as an extension of the Liberal Party.

So all of that to say, it depends on *where* those votes were, if they were all, or mostly all, from ridings where one party won by a large margin, it probably doesn't matter.

Like I already said I’m not disputing your point of “this is how it is”. Pretty sure nobody who is more than 12 years old doesn’t dispute that. I’m saying there is a moral argument that we should not fight against that trend. Of popular sovereignty is important then protecting popular sovereignty is a morally just thing to do. Often times small nations physically are not capable of single handedly fighting off a larger nation but they can group together with other nations and protect the sovereignty of the entire group as one force. If they are able to do that, and they definitely are, then there is a real argument that it is in each individual nations interest to do that. If we are considering an invasion just a border issue then an alliance is securing your border. It’s also acknowledging the moral argument of popular sovereignty as it relates to the connection between a people and their land. 

There is a limit to the historical argument. I think it’s undeniable that America was wrong in how they treated native Americans.

Imagine as a parent if you signed your kid up for online school and at the beginning of each year you basically got to pick class options and courses specifically tailored for your child. Parents would have far more control and influence over what their kids learn and individualized education would be a breeze. Your kid reads at a high level? No problem. Math whizz? Easy. Maybe needs a bit of remedial help with physics? No problem. Good luck with that in traditional public schools. 

Instead of CRT and Karl Marx like they’re getting currently in the public schools you could have them taking Latin or Ancient Greek or advanced calculus or anything else the public schools don’t offer. It would not be difficult to include more options for technical education too like auto repair and wood shop and create partnerships with local businesses for apprenticeships in the trades and such so kids can get the hands on experience along with the theoretical stuff. 

Basically what I’m saying is let taxpayers withhold payments to public schools and go this route instead. We can maintain a basic infrastructure so that all children have basic access to a public education for a fraction of the cost of brick and mortar schools. Naturally parents could pay out of pocket for extras. It’ll be cheaper and probably more effective at actual education. We could even probably take a fraction of the money saved and invest it in public libraries and such so even the poorest and literal homeless children would still have options to access internet based education.

There was also concern that some public health and medical schools were becoming so beholden to him that they were basically hiring staff that agree with the guy to keep the money flowing, and this was trickling down into the student body parroting the guy.

The CDC is comprised primarily of doctors and scientists, whose goal is generally to serve the public interest, and who are paid $40-60k per year for their work. The FDA is a food and pharmaceutical regulatory agency comprised primarily of lawyers and former pharmaceutical executives making six to seven figures annually, with all the shady dealings, lobbying, and revolving doors that have become pervasive within the federal government.

From a different perspective, none of the information or guidelines released by the CDC ever moved a company's stock up or down by billions. In contrast, almost all FDA decisions have a significant impact on some company's stock.

5463,"hy4d91r",3,0,"/r/politics","How did the fact that you’re a white man create an obstacle for you achieving those things?

“White privilege” and “male privilege” aren’t people saying you didn’t work hard. What it means is that the fact that you’re a man, or have white skin, was not something that got in your way. For women who want to buy a house in our 30s, there is an *extra* obstacle solely because of the fact that we’re women. If you’re a woman in Texas you can be forced to have a child against your will. And then face discrimination in the workplace for it, including a much lower chance of promotion, and much lower chance of pay. That’s on top of women already making less money. That’s on top of the fact that women-dominated careers, like nursing and teaching, are undeniably the two most grossly underpaid jobs in this country.

I hope you can understand how frustrating it is to still have to explain this to white men in 2022 because you don’t want to just set aside your pride for 5 minutes and Google what privilege even means. That you won’t even read the very article you’re commenting on. I hope you can understand how utterly depressing it is as a woman to have to be inundated with news, every day, of how men in power are trying to deny me bodily autonomy, and I have to sit here while you complain about how you’re a victim of discrimination because of one uncomfortable conversation with a friend.

I’m literally 7 months pregnant and if anything were to go wrong, that I’d need an abortion to save my own life, there are literally politicians in my state who are trying to take away ALL access to abortion. One politician in particular has literally tweeted, in response to “there are instances where abortion saves lives”, “What lives?” This same politician met with the president of my company just a couple months ago. And our company undoubtedly wrote him a fat check to get re-elected just so he can deregulate our industry. The men I see at work every day, who undoubtedly think they’re not misogynistic, just put a slim chance of more company profit over me having rights over my own body.

And I have to sit here and hear you complain that you’re a victim of discrimination because your friend was just as fed up with you as I am? Like fucking hell. I really tried to be as civil, and empathetic as possible when starting this comment. But literally nothing will get through to some of you. It’s just so fucking selfish and bullheaded for you to act like you’re the victim with all this shit going on. You, specifically, are a bad guy for fucking making everything about you.

I can’t make current leadership perform better. And sitting out an election isn’t going to “teach them a lesson,” which I so commonly hear. It’s only going to help keep those same candidates we lament retain power - Democrats and Republicans alike.

We need to get out and vote for FUTURE candidates we want to see make changes versus those that are regressive. That’s what midterms are about. They aren’t some “yes or no” referendum of the party at large. And treating it that way will only hurt our interests."

absolutely no buts, if Biden's donors in the financial sector want my loans repaid then I'll need to save the gas money I'd have spent on voting for democrats.

apparently neither will a democrat, so being able to vote between two conservative parties doesn't seem to do much for me.


> if you do not vote in 2022 you can kiss any thoughts of student loan debt reform goodbye

as Biden has very clearly demonstrated, even if I do vote in 2022 I am no more likely to achieve it under his watch.


> he has only had one year

he only needs about five minutes to sign the executive order. if he wants me to buy that he can't do this by executive order, he could release the redacted memo saying whether he can and start whipping congress. but he won't, because the memo says he can and he doesn't want to do it.

and for any other issue, he needs the congressional majorities he's losing in this midterm election, so I can't vote based on the rest of his promises either.

is already dead in this country and has been for decades.

If you want peace, and to keep the far-right out of power, the absolute worst thing you can do is push left-wing populism.

By all means push for policies that are good for the working class (national healthcare, stronger workers rights legislation, etc. are pretty well supported by the public), but pushing woke nonsense or socialism or racial determinism is a sure fire way to drive the working class into the arms of the far-right.

Once again undeniable links with some of **Putin’s** Russian operatives and a republican candidate has been found.
  

  
Russell Taub, in 2016 openly asked for help from Russia and he received it. The information received, included opposition research reports, RNC donor listings, polling data, as well as other information. Taub’s request wasn’t even subtle, it came in the form of a direct appeal to a foreign power for financial and/or material help in an American election. 

The dossier of materials Taub received came from the same GRU Russian Intelligence website that supplied Donald Trump’s campaign with “unsolicited” information posted on a separate web outlet (WikiLeaks). This is a direct violation of the laws that are written to prevent foreign powers from interfering in American elections.
  

  
In addition, Taub used the donor lists supplied to form a donor PAC (unregistered). A PAC he was found guilty of illegally **embezzling $1,100,000** of the $1,600,000 donors had given. Taub admitted in court to spending the money on hookers, cigars, drinks, clothing, food, airfare, travel accommodations and strip clubs.
  

  
Republican Taub ran on the pretense that he was more patriotic, the best family values, the most fiscally responsible and the best trusted GOP candidate. To say he failed to meet those ideals is an understatement."

>Conservatives are arguing that a person should use the restroom associated with the gender of their birth. Seems straight forward enough but history tells us it won't end there.

I think you’ve got a great point about conservatives loving to hyper-focus on one aspect of something as a sort of wedge issue, but i can’t say I agree with this example.

Banning trans people from using the appropriate bathroom isn’t “straightforward enough.”  It’s humiliating and dangerous for the trans person involved.

Worse, it is fundamentally unenforceable unless you’re willing to implement extraordinarily draconian laws that will affect everyone.  How do you decide who needs to prove their assigned sex at birth in the first place?  Just eyeball things and if a woman looks too butch you harass them?  Is this a thing we let cops do now?  

Even worse than that, ID and appearance alone will not do the trick, you’d need outright genital checks to be sure you aren’t just harassing a cis person(and even then SRS exists).

These are not straightforward or reasonable laws in any way.  They are already the “one step farther” you correctly identify they’ll take.

A better example of the “incremental debate” you describe, I think, is trans inclusion in sports.  That’s an area that is hard for many people to understand, and deserves a nuanced approach depending on the sport; which makes it pretty perfect for whipping people into a transphobic frenzy over.  It’s also an extraordinarily minor aspect of trans rights that affects very few people, and has no right being as big of a deal as it has been made out to be.

But once anti-trans laws and policies in that area get laid down, they become the justification for future and more serious laws/policies like the bathroom issue.  “If we don’t even let them play sports together because of strength discrepancies, can you imagine letting them use the same bathroom?”"

Conservatives tend appeal to Jesus’s _authority_. Like, “he died for your sins, are you going to disrespect him by committing sodomy?” and “God destroyed entire cities for disobeying him, are you going to defy his will?” Very much of the “are you with us or against us” mentality.

Putin is powerful but the next 15 richest dudes in Russia combined are probably more powerful and probably don't want him doing this. Are all these NATO countries really going to do nothing? I understand not physically attacking them but these countries have proven experience with making people's lives VERY difficult.

They promised ""unprecedented economic sanctions"" right? I don't understand this play. Why not do it when Trump was in office at least? Does he really schedule invasions around Olympics?"

7225,"hy0gkqz",3,0,"/r/politics","> she also supports several policies I agree with, such as universal healthcare

Summarization for brevity. C'mon dude, splitting hairs to avoid saying touche is not a good look."
7226,"hy2lwap",3,0,"/r/politics","It's an accusation of hypocrisy, however, that insists upon the unstated presumption that Hillary and Donald are roughly the same, in the grand scheme of things.

Sorry, but, it actually does matter that Donald Trump is a lifelong grifter and complete fucking moron, has a mountain of troubling foreign entanglements, and never expressed any interest in being a properly-informed president during his tenure as-such.

When you hear that Trump and his band of cronies fucked up/fucked around with classified material, it is actually quite reasonable to believe that that's a much bigger deal than when Clinton's crew did."
7227,"hy2lb1v",3,0,"/r/politics","I too am pleased.  He says this is what we see, this is what we think is about to happen, this is what we're going to do if it does.  Then it happens, and we do it.  

No rhetoric, no sword-rattling.  You do that, we do this.  I don't have to wake up every ten minutes asking, ""has the fool killed us, yet?""

It sounds simple, but for twelve out of the past twenty-one years we couldn't pull that off.   Republican leaders practiced the same deceptive politics that got them into office instead of predictable foreign policy. That's why they always got their asses handed to them on the world stage, too."
7229,"hy3a1dx",3,0,"/r/politics","Trump is a boot licking idiot! Full stop!"
7234,"hy382yb",3,0,"/r/politics","I think if W could do his presidency over, he’d be less emotional about his dad & not let Cheyney steal no much defense budget $.

He was great on free trade, he was a calm voice when we needed it, and his income tax cuts were way more equitable than other Republicans, so much so that Obama was able to make them permanent.

He wasn’t the best president, but far from the bumbling idiot the media made him out to be."
7238,"hy1i8vu",3,0,"/r/politics","Trump would have deployed our troops to help."

7266,"hy3w5a8",3,0,"/r/politics","Trump is a failed, twice impeached wanna be dictator who loves Putin and tried to sell off democracy to pay his debts. We elected a guy who treats Putin as he should be."

Hillary doesn’t deserve direct blame for that, and it was definitely exploited by right wing liars, but it’s a huge mistake to pretend the Clintons aren’t deeply despised figures in much of the US."

7299,"hxz6pc5",3,0,"/r/politics","Trump is still Trumping, likely a candidate and being sued/indicted on numerous fronts, so still a daily thing."
7309,"hy4213n",3,0,"/r/politics","I totally agree with everything you said above. But I don't think that there is a ""right"" to protest in such a way. There is a right to free speech. If you disrupt, then you are taking your chances legally."
7322,"hy4b3gl",3,0,"/r/politics","I don’t think we’ll ever truly know the depths of what went on between Putin’s people and Trump’s and what was said and arraigned behind closed doors, but it honestly could just be as simple as Trump really idolizes Putin. Think about it: both of them border on desperate to present themselves as the ultimate alpha males and seem to have the thinnest skin in the world. The only difference is Putin can get away with killing people who do things he doesn’t like. Like say a journalist or two who tell the truth. You don’t think Trump wishes he could do that?"
7325,"hy33hzo",3,0,"/r/politics","I guess the difference is Putin doesn't have incriminating videos of Biden being pissed on by Russian hookers to use as leverage."
7330,"hy38435",3,0,"/r/politics","You're wrong...full quote is..  so much worse.
  

  
“I went in yesterday and there was a television screen, and I said, ‘This is genius.’ Putin declares a big portion of the Ukraine—of Ukraine. Putin declares it as independent. Oh, that’s wonderful. So, Putin is now saying, ‘It’s independent,’ a large section of Ukraine. I said, ‘How smart is that?’ And he’s gonna go in and be a peacekeeper. That’s the strongest peace force. We could use that on our southern border. That’s the strongest peace force I’ve ever seen. There were more army tanks than I’ve ever seen. They’re gonna keep peace all right. No, but think of it. Here’s a guy who’s very savvy, I know him very well. Very, very well.”"
7331,"hy46594",3,0,"/r/politics","Either you believe in zoning laws, or you believe that Trump should be allowed to violate the building codes and let his buyers deal with the issue of whether they can resell their properties in a fair market.

Yes, it's fundamentally politically, and yes, famous developers with lots of money have been throwing their weight around since before our country was founded.

And yes, there are laws, and yes, if you flout them too boldly you get punished, and yes, its political, and yes, you deserve to be punished for being a jerk even though it's political.  Ask EVERY developer who gets caught in an economic downturn and watches his empire crash into bankruptcy."
7333,"hxzo40g",3,0,"/r/politics","Don't be ashamed. The people in congress aren't saints either. I'm not from USA, but isn't AOC a stripper or a barmaid or something too?"

7354,"hy47uvt",3,0,"/r/politics","The US has always been a constitutional republic. So they're not ""abandoning democracy.""

It seems leftists want a ""majority rule"" type full democracy, which is rather silly since nobody does it that way."

7378,"hxzmwzy",3,0,"/r/politics","My guess Trump was pretty clear that he wanted out of NATO and according to multiple sources actually started attempts to do so but was talked down by smarter people. US leaving NATO would have been a massive win for Putin and make taking Ukraine much easier. So Putin did not move aggressively on Ukraine because he was hoping on Trumps ignorance and stupidity."
7387,"hy2h1rp",3,0,"/r/politics","Weren't the last 3 appointees all per Trump?  The last one was rushed in within 1 month, so Trump could have the SCOTUS name him as the supreme leader despite the will of the American people.  Thankfully democracy prevailed this time."

7406,"hy3dvkq",3,0,"/r/politics","The same can be said with all media outlets in this country. The major media outlets are owned by 6 families each with their own agenda. It's delusional to think that only the right wing uses the media to promote disinformation.
In regards to Fox being an entertainment channel, it's a clever defense to not get sued. Crony capitalism permeates both parties. The philosophy of the right that I agree with is for lesser govt (which unfortunately allows for greedy corporations to have greater power) but in turn allows individuals, like you and I, to have more freedom. The philosophy of the left that I disagree with is for more govt (which we not only lose our freedoms, but also gives the illusion that govt will keep big corporations in check) but in reality gives career politicians more leverage in who they work for. 
There's a chart on vox, I'm sure you probably seen it, about how our votes don't really matter. And how the big monies interests that pay congress sway their decisions much greater than our votes do. Knowing this, how can you trust bigger govt to champion what the people want? They (the govt) will just trample over us."

1. We individually search around for the weakest- minded ones and pick them off one at a time to bring them back into the fold of love.

2. We speak with our dollars. We stop purchasing from the states with the most egregious offenders pushing their will and propaganda on the people (Texas and Florida especially). We stop supporting the ones who support them. We don't fight them, we just don't invite them to the party anymore.

8066,"hy4bnj4",3,0,"/r/politics","I don't know if Biden has or hasn't established a ""playbook"", but while that fact would be pertinent with regards to the ""next"" pandemic, it has no bearing on a disease which had already been ravaging the nation when Biden took office. The most effective time to stop a pandemic is in the early stages when you have the possibility to isolate and quarantine patients. For you to totally disregard the timing and the fact that Trump inherited a virus free nation, while Biden took office in the midst of a raging pandemic is disingenuous. See any difference? Or maybe you thought the Great Recession was Obama's fault, because he took office just as the crisis took hold.  
Don't just throw out a generic phrase like ""the numbers"" without giving it context.   
First, let's recognize that the pandemic didn't even begin in the US until March 2020, so I guess you'd like to give Trump an A+ for his early handling of the virus in January and February, for having zero deaths due to Covid, because, yes, there was no Covid then. When the virus did begin to take hold, cases and the deaths that followed were slow to rise, because that's how pandemic's spread. So, again, let's give credit to Trump for doing nothing, which enabled the virus to take hold and become uncontrollable. (/s)  
And again, if the numbers were worse once the vaccines became available, that certainly wasn't attributable to a failing of the vaccines, but due to vaccine hesitance, largely from the right politicizing it, largely by Republican pols. My original statement about leading conservatives to the vaccine is validated by the numbers in every credible scientific study you'd care to cite. Here's one article that puts the numbers into perspective: [COVID: Who is not vaccinated and what's the risk?](https://www.bbc.com/news/59757395)

So revue that and admit, it's largely the unvaccinated who are responsible for more deaths in 2021 vs 2020, meaning, not Biden's fault, because lord knows, he did everything he could to mandate the vaccine and caught all kinds of shit for it, but he was right.

Edit: Also if there's something deserving of valid criticism in politics, then I'm all for it being criticised by the media, regardless of sides. This isn't a sports team where you have to be a die-hard fan for your 'team'. Politicians should be serving the people and if they do something that's hurtful to the average person then they should be called out for it. They should all be held accountable for their actions in a position of power. And there is typically news reported on all of it. 

Like in this instance, praising Russia for their genius is pretty terrible and should be news worth reporting. A politician who is basically seen as the party leader who supports such vile tactics should not be a valid choice to lead a country."

The main problem that the Republican party is focusing on is inflation, how the rest of the world views the US, and finally (probably the most important one) we take serious issue with other people forcing your values on others.

Section Three of the Fourteenth Amendment disqualifies an individual from serving as a state or federal official if that person has ""engaged in insurrection or rebellion against"" the United States.

It was a clause written within the context of the Civil War but was also included to theoretically apply for members of future rebellions or insurrections against the United States. 
  

  
*A person who through prompting causes a lawless act is guilty of that act.* 
  

  
""Imminent lawless action"" is a standard currently used that was established by the United States Supreme Court in Brandenburg v. Ohio (1969) It defined the limits of freedom of speech. Brandenburg clarified what constituted a ""clear and present danger"", the standard established by Schenck v. United States (1919).

If they don't, then the employee needs to report them to their state's labor department.  I can guarantee state labor department employees will crawl up that employer's ass in a split second without blinking.

In the US, we've all been tricked into leaning heavily on tipping because it's a way for service industry employees to avoid taxes.  It's also a way for employers to avoid taxes.  The only losers are those of us that are paying taxes and don't want to participate in the silly salary negotiation with every wait-staff or hair stylist we meet.

They act like it has nothing to do with the 0.001 of Americans along with corporations racking in insane amounts of money by screwing their employees and screwing their community and nation by being tax cheats. 

These people don’t care about Americans or America. They often have their goods made out of the country, sale their yachts under other nation’s flags to avoid paying taxes. They hid assets to avoid paying their legal share which isn’t much at all thanks to all the tax cuts they’ve benefited from since the 80s. They lobbied to underfund the IRS so that only makes it harder to enforce these serial cheaters.

> Former Nazi official Albert Krebs described the scene in his memoirs: “Not all capitalists were particularly enthusiastic about the Nazis, but their skepticism was relative and ended as soon as it became clear that Hitler was the only person capable of destroying the labor movement.” Terrified by the prospect of further gains for the labor movement, capital’s support for Hitler grew rapidly.

> Trotsky illustrated the dynamic colorfully: “The big bourgeoisie likes fascism as little as a man with aching molars likes to have his teeth pulled” — that is to say, it was ugly, but it was necessary. Hitler kept his promise to capital. After being declared Chancellor in January 1933 he outlawed both workers’ parties and the trade unions within a few months. Thousands of Social Democrats, Communists and trade unionists were arrested and murdered.

Two points:

1. Unlike 1930s Germany, the other major group is clearly pro-capitalist, so these American capitalists shouldnt feel a need to turn to Nazis, and
2. Hitler and the Nazis ultimately were not good for the capitalists as they were dragged into a destructive war that ended with Germany in ruins, and with IG Farben wound up"

Why people find this so hard to do is because by default when we hate someone or something, we hate anything they do or stand for. The problem with this is that it narrows your world view quite a bit, and you miss out on things that could very much be a learning experience or to find something you like. Examples, Hitler took a country that was on the brink of utter collapse, and completely turned it around into a super power. Putin currently has the whole world eating out of his hand waiting on his next moves, and cannot directly do anything with his current moves. These are objectively bad people that have done some pretty impressive things. Others would be like the 1-2 songs Justin Beiber has that are actually pretty good.

Now, in the case of Trump, the dude is not an idiot. He is a raging narcissist and a complete garbage human, but not an idiot, and he can tell Putin is doing something QUITE clever. Usually a person would keep the fuck quiet on something like this, or talk to close friends..... but yeah, just because you dislike Putin/Trump and are unwilling to objectively look at the situation and admit dude is making some smart moves and the world is on egg shells, will lead us to WW3 for sure!!!! But it is still a pretty brilliant move.

You guys *REALLY* need to put your political worship aside for a few and just actually think for once IMO, it is starting to get really scary watching you condemn anything and everything ""the other side"" is doing... then in 4 years do the exact same shit but it is ok because it's the ""correct side"" with ""the correct think"" doing it, therefore all good. The world and it's politics and ideologies are a pendulum, the further you swing that damn axe, the sooner it will eventually swing back the other way, and the further you push it one way the further it will push back the other way when it does.

**sexual assault** in the one semester he spent in college (at one of the most ultra conservative college in America) before dropping out due to having straight Ds (his own admission), he was accused of sexual assault by a dozen women, in a letter signed by over 150 former classmates who corroborated the victim’s accounts, which represents almost 50% of the entire student body of Patrick Henry College. It was so bad and brazen that RAs and staff would warn female students to never be alone with him, and never get in his car.

Jews were given recognition for their state, largely as a result of their centuries of discrimination culminating with Holocaust, leading to the forced displacement of the Palestinian population and then leading to the conflict we see today.

9939,"hy42rqs",3,0,"/r/politics","I mean it's anecdotal but personally I've had friends that I went to school with as a kid just do a complete 180 on me as adults when we caught up. I grew up in a really diverse part of CA as a kid, I never really saw any kind of racism or racial tension in my day to day life or at school as a kid. I only really started to experience it when I was older and moved around to other states after college. 

I had a girl who I was close friends with in high school blow up on me when we caught up many years later because I mentioned I had bought a house. She started talking about how the only reason I could do that in my 30s was because of my privilege. I thought it was because I worked really hard and saved money for almost 15 years and maintained good credit. She told me I was part of what was wrong with the world and I never heard from her again. I'm not rich, I'm not poor, I have a bit of savings and I can cover my cost of living + mortgage. So I really don't know why I am a bad guy for that.

I've had a few other similar experiences (even from white friends surprisingly) where talking about any success or positivity in my life elicits a very negative racially charged response. It even happened with my ex-wife when she told me about a skinhead that worked at a grocery store she went to. She got mad at me for not being mad enough about it. I basically told her I just wouldn't go to that store anymore, she thought she needed to call the store management and the police and get him arrested or something (dude literally could have just been bald, idk I wasn't there). She called me a little white pussy when I said I'd probably leave the town I was living if it got an influx of neo-nazi residents on the streets.   

For context, I guess I'm considered white, but I'm Jewish and what was left of my family after the holocaust came here after WW2 to escape persecution. My grandfather pumped gas and lived in a black neighborhood in Detroit. My father grew up going to mostly black schools and he never had issues with his peers or neighbors growing up. I never had negative racial experiences growing up either going to a very diverse school. Maybe it was just some fortunate combination of time and place that led to that, but growing up I genuinely believed the whole ""America is a melting pot and everyone is equal"" mentality, so did my peers (at least at the time).

To people who maybe had similar situations to me it definitely feels like there is a difference in attitude. Now, even reading comments on this thread, or looking at social media, it feels like people think my entire family tree was full of slave owners and nazis (the people who literally wiped out whole branches of my family tree) just because I have pale skin. It feels like everyone in general is regressing when it comes to race.

But top comment is right, it hasn't had any major economic effect on me. I've lost a bunch of friends who just seem to want to see me for my skin color and what I own, vs. who I am as a person and that sucks, but it could definitely be worse. Obviously the OP article isn't about people like me, but the problem is that I get lumped into the same category as those people. I guess some people would think maybe I deserve that somehow, but to me that comes off pretty racist."

Beyond that, I get that they've done very little but we need to make at least this one last push to get a bigger gap in the Senate. Right now, they're crippled because a 1 vote majority is no majority at all because all it takes is one asshole (like Manchin and/or Senima) to derail an entire agenda.

>if there is a change in the student's services or monitoring related to the student's mental, emotional, or physical health or well-being 

Which is understood to mean ""if the student comes out or is known to be questioning their gender identity or sexuality."" 

The amendment being withdrawn would have removed this section:

>This subparagraph does not prohibit a school district from adopting procedures that permit school personnel to withhold such information from a parent if a reasonably prudent person would believe that disclosure would result in abuse, abandonment, or neglect, as those terms are defined in s. 39.01.

There's also this section:

>Classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.

So, when that one kid in kindergarten has two dad's, the teacher is prohibited from teaching why or how that is. Not to mention that those state standards don't exist yet, so it's impossible to say exactly what will be allowed and when.

Also, the bill is explicit about parents having access to *all* health and education records of their kids, so if a student isn't comfortable talking to their parents about something, they better not talk to another trusted adult at school or it'll eventually make it back to them."
10830,"hy4cidh",3,0,"/r/politics",">Why would you think they are being sarcastic?

Because Manchin and Sinema both have a track record of simply being really shitty people, who've demonstrated they're willing to avoid doing the right thing when it matters most, and I couldn't tell if OP also held that opinion or not, because a lot of people seem to be of that opinion.

See, sometimes it makes sense to toe the party line so as not to attract unwanted attention. When you're Joe Manchin or Kirsten Sinema that attention can come quickly and easily. So it makes sense to vote in favour of things that have the widespread support so as not to make you look like a dissenter. But if their financial overlords need them to be the swing vote on something that favours corporate interests, I could easily see them flipping (and in the case of Sinema, making a bad show of it, because reasons? She confuses the shit out of me, honestly).

I've seen too much hypocrisy to think they wouldn't relish the opportunity to halt progress at the last second for a few extra bucks. I see it almost like if they were to help write a piece of legislation and then voted against it - which tends to happen in Washington more often than I'd care to see.

I'm seriously not trying to ""doom"" post - whatever happens is going to happen, and my opinion is inconsequential enough that it won't make a difference. Besides, I also don't think this issue remotely approached anything remotely close to ""doom"" levels of urgency (Ukraine is currently undergoing a crisis of such measures if anyone is interested in doom). I'm saying I don't trust them. Do you trust them? How far does that trust go? Why?

At the end of the day, I'll do what I can to turn the heat up on those clowns - even if it makes the one person I'm replying to question what their actual motives are, because those arseholes are acting in bad faith, so far as I can see, and their motives absolutely deserve to be questioned at every step going forward. They have no business being ""public servants"" as they're both very much corporate servants, as far as I can see."
